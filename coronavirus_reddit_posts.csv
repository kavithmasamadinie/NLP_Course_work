The federal government provides additional resources to state and local governments in the event their capacity is exceeded.

fg0dlw,CoronavirusUS,PSA to Young People: Do not make the mistake of assuming that current # of confirmed cases is an indication of threat level.,3/10/2020 3:36,"A lot of young people in their 20s and 30s seem to think they are invincible. It's business as usual for them... bar-hopping, nightclubs, house parties, random Tinder dates, vacations, large group dinners, etc.

&#x200B;

(1) People have a tendency to downplay their own personal risk to avoid anxiety and fear.

Reality check: There is less to be afraid of if you and your friends take precautions today instead of acting like the threat doesn't exist for you.

&#x200B;

(2) People don't like to be the first to speak / act. Change is uncomfortable and sometimes embarrassing.

Reality check: Your friends might troll you at first and say ""you're overreacting"", but it is far more embarrassing to end up in the hospital after ignoring all warnings than being the first smart person in your social circle. Be a leader, not a follower. Remember the high school bully who turned in to a loser? Yeah, don't be that guy.

&#x200B;

(3) People are drawing comparisons that are not comparable. You've probably seen your Instagram stories saying that this is just like Swine flu, ebola, etc. and overblown by the media.

Reality check: This virus is much, much different than those. The people sharing these stories are the exact people who have avoided informing themselves and not read a single medical report.

&#x200B;

(4) People tend to over-index on current data and under-index on the trend.

Reality check: Today's number are already 3-4 weeks old.

Do not make the mistake of assuming that current # of confirmed cases is an indication of threat level.

The decline in new cases seen in South Korea, China, Macau, Singapore, and hopefully soon Italy, is only a result of their proactive measures.

We are at least 3-4 weeks behind if we plan our response based on the current number of confirmed cases. This is magnified by the fact that our testing has been and continues to be almost non-existent.

&#x200B;

Summary to all:

Please take precautions as individuals. We CAN beat this together. If only 50% of the population took basic precautions (social distancing, washing hands, wearing masks, etc.), we would significantly reduce the spread.

Put your group dinners, Tinder dates, house parties, etc. on hold for 2-3 weeks, and all of your friends will still be there for dinner next month. If you don't, they may not be.",520,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fg0dlw/psa_to_young_people_do_not_make_the_mistake_of/

ffyurk,CoronavirusUS,Taking Kids out of School Voluntarily: Our Principal's Response,3/10/2020 2:04,"Today we informed the principal of our kids elementary school that we were taking out kids out of school due to the State of Emergency in Maryland and NIH's recommendation that we avoid large public gatherings. My wife and I then spoke to the Principal by phone. We explained that because of the lack of testing and and our ability to work from home we want to be part of the solution, rather than contributing to what could be a problem.

We understand that not everyone is a position to remove their kids from school, but by reducing the number of kids in school voluntarily we can help reduce the demands put on teachers and the threat to kids still in school and their families.  

We weren't sure how the school would respond. Would we need to withdrawal our kids and start homeschooling? Turns out they are fully supporting our decision and told us it would not affect our kids standing the classroom. Details still needs to be worked out so our kids stay current. The Board of Education is also in the middle of discussing all possible scenarios.

fj370j,CoronavirusUS,My experience wearing a mask in rural East Texas while shopping,3/15/2020 23:42,"I wore an N95 mask and purple medical nitrile gloves to Walmart and CVS to stock up on a few items. Not a single person anywhere was wearing a mask. Here were the responses:

* A kid cried because he thought I looked scary and the parents shot me angry looks
* A guy in one aisle took one look at me and said ""oh sheeeeit hell naw nigga"" and did a complete 180, didn't see him in the store again
* Some people made fun of me in the parking lot by rolling their window down and making sneezing noises
* The CVS cashier was angry and threw my basket on the ground as I was walking out and sprayed a whole can of lysol on it, I guess she thought I was infected
* One person commented that I must not believe in God to protect me since I'm wearing a contraption on my face
* People snuck pictures of me on every aisle, to post on FB I guess
* Lots of laughs and eye rolls

Even though the shelves are bare, no meat, no water, no TP, I don't think people are taking their health seriously, except maybe the guy that did the 180 and the CVS lady.

Ive been staying home since yesterday and have enough food to last me 2 weeks for me and my family. 

My dad and mom are still gonna work and im worried for them, theres bills to pay that can't be unpaid. Hopefully they close soon and file for unemployment.  

Im gonna look into truck driving since it's still in demand and my brother gets paid decently and you're not exposed go people.

what the fuck is the point in opening a restaurant with 300 chairs and only having  20 of those actually being taken up when there's usually 100. 

Seriously fuck you Landry's for not shutting down.

And also in case you've never worked at a resturant, You havent seen shit. Obviously there's good restaurants with responsibile owners that care. Then you have greedy corporations like landry's that dont give a fuck about you and their replaceable workers.

-cooks scratching their balls then cooking food
-cooks dropping shit and cooking it because ""the heat kills pathogens""
-cooks that dont know the difference between cleaning and disinfecting. 
-No one having a fucking clue that sanitizer and peroxide have to sit for 3-5minutes to work.(at least ecolab)
-servers grabbing croutons with their filthy hands(no gloves)
-cooks and servers not washing their hands in the restroom. 
-cooks slapping each others assess. 
-staff showing up sick as fuck when they should clearly be home
-tables being cleaned in 5 seconds without the proper disinfecting time.
-Servers smoking 24/7
-Everyone's being underpaid so the thought process is ""fuck it"".
- Ice buckets used to carry floor cleaner and other chemicals.
-Ice buckets left next to soda stations minutes at a time while multiple servers walk around it.
Restrooms barely cleaned thoroughly and properly disinfected. If you want to call spraying peroxide and wiping it off with TP is cleaning be my guest.

fiicte,CoronavirusUS,From a friend,3/14/2020 21:28,"I am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality.  The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today. 

If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.

I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”

There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.  

When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse. 

Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left? 

On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse. 

There are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?

And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment. 

You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time. 

And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago. 

Soon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now.

fk81g0,CoronavirusUS,Seriously thinking about leaving my husband after this blows over,3/18/2020 0:20,"Our city has many confirmed cases of covid-19 and my husband refuses to stay home. I am immunocompromised with a history of pneumonia and we have two small children. My children and I started self isolating 2 weeks ago in our home but my husband still comes and goes as he pleases. We are financially stable and can afford for him to take a couple of weeks off of work but he is more worried about his shift not being able to be covered. I have begged him for weeks to please stop putting us at risk and to just stay home but he will not listen. I am beginning to give up on him and on us and it is the worst feeling, almost worse than the actual threat of the virus. The person I have always counted on is not being the person I always thought he was. He thinks I am over reacting and is reminding me of other things that can kill me other than this virus and I don’t even know what to tell him anymore.

Update - thanks to everyone who replied I appreciate your concern and advice it means a lot. My husband came home from work sick yesterday. Fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, the works. I made him go to the hospital and he actually met the criteria to get the covid-19 test. He won’t get the results for days though so in the meantime he’s quarantined off in another part of the house away from my kids and I but I’m still taking care of him. It’s sad that this is what it took for him to stay home. I just hope he didn’t already give me whatever he has.

fh68se,CoronavirusUS,Can I anonymously report a hospital?,3/12/2020 7:03,"My moms hospital is refusing testing of multiple patients with symptoms, and is actively asking all employees to basically keep quiet and not say anything. I just found out one of my moms patients that did get tested was positive, and the hospital isn’t testing her or anyone exposed, and is also withholding information which means everyone may now carry it. Is there any anonymous thing I can do or complain? I don’t want to contact the news myself and get my mom fired, but this is fucking absurd.

Edit: Got more info, it’s not the docs or anyone limiting testing it’s the CDC that has the final say to allow it or not? So tldr no ones getting tested thanks to the long and strenuous process of getting the cdc to approve testing someone, who in that span will contact hundreds if not thousands of people 

In terms of keeping quiet, they were given flyers about how to direct all outside questions to hospital PR, but verbally told to not talk.


Update edit: I reached out to couple of local reporters anonymously and I’ll post if they get back to me. By the looks of what I’ve read here and elsewhere, it seems like this shit is happening across the country.

Edit 2: the patient from 2 weeks ago came back positive. So for two weeks, every single nurse was working full time and is STILL NOT getting tested.

Probably final UPDATE: hilarious. Hospital quarantined a bunch of members last night due to real exposure. Today, they downgraded a bunch of people off of the quarantine list and those with coughing symptoms were told it’s probably just the flu. And are making them go back to work.

ffe5lo,CoronavirusUS,It feels like the 2 months time China has bought the world is not being used wisely in most places.,3/8/2020 23:37,"I’m bilingual, mandarin and English. I’ve been watching for 2 months news and discussions on Chinese media and among Chinese communities about China dealing with it. Stage by stage. Sad stories, moving stories. People’s confusion, concerns, anger and frustration. Organizations’ fast responses and failures to follow protocols. Medical insurance policy changes. Researches evolving rapidly as more cases were studied. 

And of course, Rumors flying among social media. Clarifications came in later. Then people argue with each other holding their own opinions. 

Now I’m watching the US going through very similar cycles. People are asking the same questions that have been asked 2 month ago. Similar discussions. Similar arguments. 

Just want to share some common beliefs among Chinese people who are 2 months ahead of everywhere else. Not saying these are right or wrong. Just want to share. And since they are perceived by me, they’re also very subjective. 

• Wear a mask, properly, if you’re in public buildings, especially with a crowd. Avoid crowds, even in open spaces. You don’t know who has it and most of them do not show any symptom in early stages and can still pass it on. 

 • Avoid handshakes, hugs or kisses. 

• Disinfect your household and this includes washing hands properly often. 

• If possible, try to stay home and avoid going out. And this includes going grocery-shopping. And that’s why you should stock up stuff that have long shelf life- so that you don’t have to go to stores as often. 

• Pay close attention to elderlies in your family and if someone is showing symptoms, do not go to visit them. You can show your caring and loving through video calls. 

• If you are showing mild symptoms, self quarantine right away. Don’t guess maybe it’s just an allergy or a flu. Because you care about those who live under the same roof with you. If symptoms continue or get worse, be sure to see a doctor.",324,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/ffe5lo/it_feels_like_the_2_months_time_china_has_bought/

fjpr95,CoronavirusUS,"PSA: Stay home unless absolutely necessary, our lives and healthcare workers depend on it.",3/17/2020 2:28,"Let’s make this clear: This is not the flu. 

We have no natural immunity (you got corona and now have immunity) or herd immunity (enough people are immune from either getting it or being vaccinated) or vaccines to prevent COVID-19. 

The flu, while ever mutating and unpredictable, has some immunity — still deadly. But when the flu, aka influenza, hit us the first time ever and we had no immunity, guess what? Most of us fucking died. 

The “lucky” thing with the COVID-19 is that it is targeting certain populations and not everyone. Although, it is not lucky at all for those people and that is why is is important that every single person does their part to stop the spread of this virus. 

Let me tell you why this is a big deal:

1) You have no immunity. 

It will go through our population without any resistance. If it keeps on mutating, as viruses do, we could have even worse outcomes. Like, idk, targeting healthy populations as the flu mutated to do (think swine flu — still the flu, but more deadly. Or H2N2 that killed 2 million worldwide and over 60,000 people in the UNITED STATES alone in the 1950s) Or even a strain of Coronavirus — as we saw with SARS. Maybe it becomes even more transmissible. We don’t know. But we do need a vaccine — one that will be ineffective if it mutates too much. 

It is NOT that the flu is more deadly — any mutated virus can become more or less contagious and more or less deadly. It mutates when it infects people. Another very important reason to stop transmission by staying home. We are trying to slow infections to slow mutations. Even if you have mild symptoms, it doesn’t mean that you didn’t cause a deadlier mutation. Also, remember — NO IMMUNITY. So imagine a very deadly and contagious version of COVID-19 that we have no immunity or vaccine to. STAY HOME. 

2) It is highly contagious and possibly even airborne. 

It is between droplet and airborne. The particles are small enough to float in the air for longer periods of time. It stays on surfaces for REALLY LONG periods of time (72 hours on hard surfaces like metal). 
Of course, with testing being limited, we can only guess on how contagious.

We are guessing right now:

- Flu: 1 person gets infected — 1.3 are infected

- COVID-19: 1 person gets infected — 3 people are infected

So 1 person becomes 3, 3 become 9, 9 becomes 27, 27 becomes 81, 81 becomes 243, and so on. Remember that started with ONLY ONE PERSON. So if you take yourself out of this equation, you will be preventing so many others from being infected. You make the difference. I promise. 

If you don’t know you have it, then you are carrying it around and passing on a virus without even realizing it. 

3) Incubation without symptoms is waaay too long. 

Imagine you get the flu, in 1-4 days, you will start to feel symptoms and stay home as to not spread the flu and also because you feel bad.

But not COVID-19. Your ass is running around town, doing errands and pretending like nothing is wrong for up to 14 DAYS. That is a lot of people you encountered. And the web will grow and grow and grow unless people stay away from other people. 

EDIT: A study done in Italy on a town of ~3,000 people: everyone got swabbed. 

What we found out:
- A large percent of the population is infected

- 50-75% of people will not have symptoms

- Most people that do not show symptoms are younger and therefore the ones that are DRIVING THE TRANSMISSION. Stay home young people. Even if you feel fine because there’s a 50-75% chance you’re currently contagious and infecting others. 

- Side note: 50-25% WILL have symptoms — and that is a lot of people. That’s ~185 million /~370 million in the US. With 1% mortality (7% shown in Italy), that is between 3.72 million - 25.9 people will die in the United States. 

You are transmitting COVID-19 those entire 14 days without any symptoms at all. And we have no immunity. Now you see why it will just go through our population quickly and without resistance — this moves us to concern number 4:

4) Healthcare system collapse:
Do you know how many ventilators a small hospital has? Not that fucking many. I think we have like maybe 3? So guess what? The first three that are sick and need them — they get them. What if you have complications? YOU WON’T GET ONE.

And that’s how thousands of people die. Not because we don’t have the capability to treat you, but because we don’t have enough room to treat you. 

And if you don’t believe me, I’d like you to please look at what’s happened in China and Italy.

For the sake of driving this home, let’s do the math:

Even if the numbers for mortality is “just” 1% (again, we need more testing and to test every person who even has slight symptoms to get accuracy):

Population of the United States: 372 Million 

1% of the population that will die: 3.72 million people

We don’t have room for that number of patients and that’s not including the people that require serious respiratory intervention, that’s just mortality. The hospitals will flood. Healthcare workers won’t have enough equipment to protect themselves. Those healthcare workers will get sick and not be able to come to work or suffer more serious complications. OR they don’t have symptoms and transmit it to many more patients. Do you see the cycle? 

Too many patients at once, not enough staff/equipment to treat everyone.

Again, STAY HOME.

5) Testing has been a joke in the US:

Please tell me why South Korea can test 66,000 in one week while the US only tested 1900 — and MANY people, including exposed healthcare workers, were being DENIED for it. True numbers are not known. Do you think it’s bad now? You actually have no idea, nor does anyone else because we haven’t been adequately testing everyone.

Also, turnaround time in South Korea is like a day to get your results. In Michigan? I’ve heard 3 days. And Henry Ford says 4-5 days. And another said up to 7 days. THAT IS TOO LONG. People need to know so they aren’t just thinking “oh maaaaybe I don’t have it” and then go off doing their normal things. And we need real time numbers to know where this virus is traveling — not numbers from a week ago. 

6) Some of you may be wondering why we are worried about us following Italy’s footsteps if Italy has a much smaller population and we have a much larger one. Can’t be that big of deal, right? 

Two words: POPULATION. DENSITY.

Put population density US map into the Google machine and see that we are condensed in pockets. That’s lots of people in one area that can all transmit — most of them don’t even know they are transmitting. And there’s millions that will suffer serious cases if we do not isolate ourselves RIGHT NOW (Please remember — too many cases + not enough room = people die, many more suffer serious complications and we keep furthering mutations and infections and... it just gets way, way worse).

The hardest area hit in Italy has about 9,000 people per sq mile. Manhattan has 67,000 people per square mile. This means way more people come into contact with each other in a smaller area. And refer to above to point number 2: 1 person infected will infect 3 people and see how quickly that web grows. There’s 67,000 in one square mile spreading it exponentially like that. Just one square mile. That’s not a big area and a lot of people.

Staying home will save lives. I promise you. 

7) This is the real danger: YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDED PREVENTION STRATEGIES. 

I saw your bar snapchat stories. Seriously? It is wild in a time that requires everyone to be on board to protect us that you can’t keep your ass ta home and put on some fucking Friends to watch on the couch. 

Stay home. You are risking lives. And no, not just because someone could get it that’s immunocompromised or elderly — and that’s a pretty good reason — but because our healthcare system does not have enough room for the infection rates projected. PLEASE look at why an entire country is quarantined and ask yourself... do I really need to risk all of that or will I continue to be selfish? 

The ONLY tool we have is social distancing. Washing your hands will only go so far if it’s partially airborne. This is me begging you to listen. Do not leave your house. Get your can of beans you panic bought and crack it open in front of some Netflix because we need your help. Every single person on this planet needs you to do your part. You can handle staying home, I promise. 

Thank you.

fiwle9,CoronavirusUS,Lack of respiratory therapists will be a North America specific problem that will make our healthcare system collapse faster than others we’ve seen.,3/15/2020 13:33,"In the US & Canada, ventilators are set up and managed by licensed and registered respiratory therapists. This job doesn’t exist in the rest of the world, it’s done by physicians and critical care nurses with some other secretion management aspects performed by physical therapists. 

Respiratory therapists perform virtually every aerosol generating procedure (highest risk of transmission) they’re involved in every intubation  and transport of a ventilated patient. 

In non teaching hospitals, they’re often the provider performing the intubation and placing arterial lines, which is a standard for blood pressure monitoring in the critically ill.  I work at a large academic institution so resident physicians perform these duties at my work, but I’ve also worked at a small rural hospital where these duties were mine alone, sometimes being the only one in house. 

In the U.S., registered nurses simply aren’t trained to manage a ventilator. In fact, the majority of nurses can’t manage a critically ill patient - only critical care nurses can. They are amazing at managing a ventilated patient overall but not the equipment. A ventilator doesn’t run itself. It’s not something you plug in, turn on, connect a human to and walk away from. It’s a dynamic and complex situation. Physicians are no experts either. Ask anyone on a critical care team - ventilation / oxygenation issues ? Call respiratory. 

These patients will have an incredible pneumonia that will be difficult to manage. Look at the images in Italy - there are roomfuls of proned patients. That is an incredibly intensive often last resort way to treat respiratory failure. 

There are about 135,000 respiratory therapists in the U.S. Where will we manufacture more of them? Where will we find more of the healthcare workers that are highly skilled and specifically trained in dealing with respiratory illness and life supportive equipment? 

Nobody is talking about this. It’s blowing my mind. This is one of the first things I’ve read that even touches on it 

Source: I’m a registered respiratory therapist and an adult critical care specialist. My degree is in respiratory care.

fkhvu0,CoronavirusUS,The hidden fees of the testing process,3/18/2020 10:14,"Just personally experienced the Covid-19 testing process in Michigan USA, and it wasn't a great experience. 

I am showing symptoms of being sick (cold like symptoms; congestion and fever) and was encouraged to get tested by others. I heard Beaumont in Dearborn, MI had drive through Coronavirus testing so my brother and I drove over there. We arrived just after 3pm and I did not get tested until 7pm. A four hour wait. Even though we live together and he was in the car with me the entire time, he was not allowed to get tested. I was told that my symptoms technically weren't enough to get tested (99.7 degree fever isn't a fever, 100+ is, and the only positive cases they've had there were both struggling to breathe) but they were still *willing* to test me. They informed me that I would be tested for the flu and then, if that comes back negative, Covid-19. I had a flu vaccine four months ago but that didn't matter. The process seemed reasonable enough to me. (We'll come back to this later) 

After getting tested we waited another hour for discharge. On the surface this seems like a pretty standard hospital wait time. But then the kicker came... 

Just prior to discharge I was told I will be charged $250 for this process. I was confused because I've been hearing all about how testing is being made free to all Americans with symptoms. It was explained to me that the Emergency Room visit and Flu test are not the Covid-19 test so I owe money for those services. I was asked to consent to proceed with testing (after being there 5 hours) and if I didn't then I wouldn't be charged but my test would not be submitted, aka I wasted most of my day. They said someone would call me later to discuss insurance options and options for lowering the cost of this whole process. I consented, as fortunately I can afford the $250, but not everyone can and pressure like that puts people in a tough decision making spot. 

After I left, I received the call from the financial support department to discuss payment options. I didn't qualify for their financial assistance program (I didn't expect to) but she was able to waive 76% of the fees just for speaking with her. I explained that I was told it will be $250 and asked if that means 76% off of the $250 or if the $250 quote included the discount. She then explained that **$250 was NOT the full cost of my entire visit, that was just the cost of the ER Room fee.** The $250 will be *part of* my bill, but not the entire bill, and then the entire bill will get 76% off. She did explain that the government has been talking about waiving the entire visit cost, which I thought was the case when you hear ""Coronavirus testing is free"" but that hasn't happened yet. She definitely was apologetic and wants to get it discounted as much as possible for me which I appreciate and don't blame the hospital for, but the cost was there nonetheless. 

SO BE WARNED if you do not have health insurance and cannot afford a minimum of $250 for testing you will not be eligible for the Covid-19 test EVEN IF YOU’RE SHOWING SYMPTOMS. They will just discard your test. After a 5 hour wait if you can’t afford it — bye bye.

We've been told that we will only have access to surgical masks when in contact with infected patients due to the short supply the N95 mask. Our staff brought up the concerned that surgical mask will not prevent the airborne pathogen when we are in the infected patients ICU room, but our management told us that we are not allowed to use a 95 mask regardless. They said because we have a short exposure time with a patient, sometimes up to 30 mins at a time, that the infection control officers said that we would not contract the virus. 

When I asked my management if the hospital will pay for our mandated quarantine if a patient gets us sick, and we were told that as of now the hospital will not pay us and that we would be required to use our own sick leave, vacation time, or advanced vacation time.

One of my co-workers said that it's bullshit that Walmart employees are being offered two weeks of paid leave if they are to be self quarantined, while government healthcare workers are being told to deal with it, and our management just shrugged it off and told us that it's an executive decision.

So now our entire department is absolutely furious that we are being offered limited protection and are being told that if we get sick due to the limited protection, that we would not be compensated for the occupational hazard.

fh9wui,CoronavirusUS,"I work in the epicenter (kirkland), interacted often with multiple now-positive people, travelled outside the US recently, and have worsening symptoms and still can't get tested. [27F]",3/12/2020 11:19,"Over the past 2.5 days I've had worsening symptoms of rough dry coughing, discomfort while breathing, and an ongoing high fever and massive headache. Today I actually now have vertigo and hallucinations from my headache d fever (steady 101-102°).

Below are actions I took to try and get tested. I've been requested to get this from my place of work to ensure others  are notified. I should note that testing is also important from a community surveillance, data, and battle position, not just confirming the fact that someone has it.

- Many emails and calls asking my primary care doctor for information on where to get tested. In summary, she said I'm probably fine, and if it worsens to go to the ER (I'm not paying 5k for salt water and a pat on the back). She would not release locations of testing, and said they do not have the ability to test at any of the valley medical clinics or urgent cares.

- Multiple calls to the CDC (took 3 to finally reach a human) - they didnt believe me and told me that am too young (regardless of all the other criteria), still not releasing where I can get a test around Seattle. 

- Multiple calls to Aetna (my insurance) - they kept transferring me between departments, hanging up, & taking no responsibility in information sharing, or telling me where to go. Instead directing me to CDC or King County DOH. They genuinely seemed clueless.

- Calls to King County DOH - once answered operator would connect me through to the King County Corona Virus Call Group. The operator told me telling that they are specifically the ones to share the information on locations of where to get a test. Which, based in their names, seems like the accurate responsibility. 4 calls transferred there: first one 30 minutes hold, to which I hung up and radialed, second one a 67 minute hold to which I was hung up on (literally heard them pick up and hang up), third call never stopped ringing, and fourth, rang a few times then went to busy dial tone.

I suppose I wont bother getting tested, and just stay home and monitor myself. If I get worse, of course I'll go to the ER - so far still declining. The funny thing is if I get a positive test, Aetna has a bunch of care and package assistance stuff to ensure I get better and don't have to go out and spread it to receive their care, but again... I would need a test for that.

In the meantime, I'm sure I'll survive, but like..... really? REALLY? This is being VERY poorly handled.

ffvkqh,CoronavirusUS,"This isn’t the flu, so don’t call it that",3/9/2020 22:35,"We all have that relative, friend, or coworker that exclaims “COVID-19 is just the flu, stop panicking”. Perhaps that’s you . In fact my uncle told me if we reported the seasonal flu like the coronavirus we’d all be panicking all the time, maybe that’s true. 

But let’s be clear, this isn’t the flu, and here’s why. 

1) R naught:
This is the number of people one infected person is likely to infect. 
For the flu, that’s about 1.3. So if Jimmy gets the flu he usually only gives it to Jane. That’s it. 
1 in infects 1, that next person infects someone else so now 3 people have it. No biggie. 

For COVID-19 the estimates vary, but one very common approximation is 3. For every one person infected they spread it to 3 others. So now Jimmy has spread this to Sally, Jane, and Anwar. Now each of those people infect three more. That’s 9 people. It spreads exponentially faster. 
Plus if we’re missing milder cases in the young healthy folks than perhaps the R0 is higher, but let’s just stick with 3 for now. No need for panic or sensationalism. 

2) Asymptomatic Transmission 

Okay so yes this one is currently a large unknown in the world of COVID-19. So keep that in mind. 
But normally when you get the flu, you’re contagious for about 1 day before symptoms. Then you feel like crap and hopefully stay home so you don’t give the office your plague. 
However this could be longer for coronavirus, so even when you feel great and give grandma a big old hug you could’ve given her the surprise of a lifetime... the novel coronavirus. Sorry granny. 

3) Incubation period 

For the flu this is about 1-4 days. That means it takes 4 days between getting infected and feeling like crap. Now I don’t know about you all but I can usually remember which friend of mine was sick and coughed on me in the last few days. There’s generally no doubt who gave me the flu. Dammit Jimmy, I told you to stay home. 

Again there are a lot of unknowns with COVID-19 but estimates for incubation range from 2-14 days. Not I definitely cannot remember which coworker was coughing two weeks ago, but maybe that’s just me. 
This may make it harder to find the source of infections and track all cases/possible transmissions which is an important part of containment. 

4) the number everyone loves. The mortality rate. 

Okay so yes, here’s where that one friend isn’t totally wrong. The flu and COVID-19 are semi-comparable here. 

— — — 
EDIT: There is variation in the statistics for both as we don’t have a consensus for COVID-19 and the flu varies each year in its severity (some years it kills more, some years less). Please read below for the mortality statistics others were so kind to share. 
But keep in mind the mortality rate for COVID-19 is currently estimated to be above that of the flu. The flu kills around 0.1-1% and COVID-19 is estimated around 2-3%, however this may not be accurate if we are missing milder cases. On the flip side missing milder cases increases the R0. 
—end edit— 
— — — 

But, the way they kill you is different. The most common way you die from the flu is post-viral pneumonia. After the flu your body is suspect over to takeover from other microbes, usually Strep. Pneumoniae, H.flu, and S. Aureus (for those who don’t know, those are bacteria). Lucky for most we’ve got antibiotics to help you through. 

COVID-19 is a different beast. It’s causing ARDS which stands for acute respiratory distress syndrome, creative name huh? Now this is treated with low tidal volume ventilation. A machine helps you breathe but only short shallow breathes, because well the damages lungs can’t handle the depth of normal breaths. 

So in terms of mortality sure the rates could be similar but how you die may vary. 

—Edit: please scroll to see some of the mortality estimates that Jollyroger84103 posted in the comments — 

5) Seasonality 

Thankfully the flu only comes to bite us once a year during the all mighty flu season. 

COVID-19 could be seasonal orrrr it could not. Again we don’t know yet. However, right now it’s infecting different hemispheres and places along the equator which may mean that summer won’t be the end of this bug.


Therefore, yes take all the same precautions as you would during flu season. Fun fact, you should already be washing your damn hands, avoiding touching your face, sneezing into your elbow, staying home when sick and standing 6 feet away from Jimmy McCough. 

Don’t go hug granny when you’re sick, which hopefully you don’t do anyways. 

But don’t go around saying this is just the flu, because it’s not.

fgyzq6,CoronavirusUS,"Taking early precautions like social distancing is not ""panicking""",3/11/2020 23:34,"I've made the conscious decision for my family to begin practicing social distancing now - early, at a time when the rest of my community has not recognized the magnitude of the pending threat. 

This is difficult for me because I am keeping myself and my family members home from events in which we dearly wish to participate, and I am doing this at a time where doing so has *not yet* become socially acceptable. But I have no doubt that it will become acceptable in the coming days or weeks. 

So I want to address my concern with the currently ubiquitous warning by public officials and everyday citizens alike to “not panic.” This is so frustrating to me.

To be fair, I kind of get why people keep saying not to panic. I understand that there is a fear that the public will panic and devolve into chaos. They are afraid that there will be violence, riots (really? who the hell is going to assemble together for a riot right now?), and lawlessness.

Here’s the definition of panic:

Panic - Sudden uncontrollable fear or anxiety, often *causing wildly unthinking behavior*. (emphasis mine)

Source: [https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/panic](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/panic)

It is dangerous when people accuse those who are taking general precautions early in this crisis of “panicking.” Practicing social distancing right now is not “wildly unthinking behavior.” It is thoughtfully taking action out of an abundance of caution.

Maybe I'm just getting to the point where I've heard the word ""panic"" so much that it's grating on my brain. But I feel like a better message would be to tell the public to ""be smart, reasonable, cautious, considerate, and prepared, and...don't be an asshole"" (looking at hoarders buying entire inventories of Purell).

People who are taking precautions and making sacrifices now should not be ridiculed for it or accused to panicking.

In judicial opinions, there is often discussion of the balancing of burdens. When a court has to make a difficult decision, such as whether or not to grant an injunction, the court considers the burden of the measure required to ensure protection from a harm and weighs it against the magnitude of the harm itself, as well as the likeliness that the harm will occur. The more harmful the threat is, the lower the thresholds are for both the burden imposed and the likeliness for the threat to occur.

In this case, the likeliness is high, and although we are being told that the harm is not high (e.g. like a cold or flu/only old and sick people will die), the fatality rate (to the extent that we can capture it) is not insignificant. The burden, for the most part, is money. We will have to make a choice in weighing how much we value money over the lives and health of ourselves and our loved ones, particularly those who are elderly, infirm, and those who depend on us to support them. Otherwise healthy medical workers suffer an even greater risk.

We are all going to lose money from this. I have already canceled plans and all the money is forfeit. I really really hate that, but I have to accept it, because, as difficult as it is to do, I am fighting to resist “normalcy bias” and the compulsion of the “sunk cost fallacy” ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy\_bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias)

[https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/)). These are human tendencies that dangerously encourage individuals to continue on an established course of action, even if such action is against their own interest, merely because they’ve already invested time or money in it.

No amount of money *already spent* is worth embracing (through willful negligence) the tragedy and suffering that we are already seeing amongst our fellow human beings in China, South Korea, Italy, the middle east, and many other countries that failed to proactively address the threat.",237,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fgyzq6/taking_early_precautions_like_social_distancing/

fi833m,CoronavirusUS,The scariest thing for me is the possibility of hospitals getting overwhelmed and being forced to choose who gets life-saving treatment,3/14/2020 6:25,"It's [this](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/13/opinion/coronavirus-cautionary-tale-italy-dont-do-what-we-did/?p1=HP_Feed_ContentQuery) opinion piece that freaked me out, because it's straight from someone who's been through it in Italy.

That is horrifying. The author is suggesting we implement Italy's lockdown policies but I'm not seeing the US anywhere close to adopting that, even though it's clear where we are headed.

>Until last week, the Italian public health care system had the capacity to care for everyone. Our country has universal health care, so patients aren’t turned away from hospitals here. But in a matter of days, the system was being felled by a virus that I, and many other Italians, had failed to take seriously.

>The inability of the medical system to deal with the flow of patients in critical condition is not one of the problems of this complex medical emergency. It is *the* problem. I shouldn’t have been surprised. As a journalist, I had read, heard, and spoken to several experts explaining that the most immediate threat of Covid-19 was the hospital system becoming overwhelmed, and therefore the most pressing need was to avoid too many people getting sick at the same time, as resources are limited. (It’s what’s called “flattening the curve.”)

>But that information was somehow stored in some remote interstice of my mind, covered by an incessant flow of bits and charts on the mortality rate of the elderly, political mismanagement, quarrels over under-testing and over-testing, market collapses, projections on the economic impact of the epidemic, and so on. All of this is, of course, extremely relevant — but at the same time feels totally irrelevant when lives are being lost in a situation that was preventable. As of Friday night, 1,266 people have died in Italy due to the outbreak.

>So here’s my warning for the United States: It didn’t have to come to this.

>We of course couldn’t stop the emergence of a previously unknown and deadly virus. But we could have mitigated the situation we are now in, in which people who could have been saved are dying. I, and too many others, could have taken a simple yet morally loaded action: We could have stayed home.

>What has happened in Italy shows that less-than-urgent appeals to the public by the government to slightly change habits regarding social interactions aren’t enough when the terrible outcomes they are designed to prevent are not yet apparent; when they become evident, it’s generally too late to act. I and many other Italians just didn’t see the need to change our routines for a threat we could not see.

>Italy has now been in lockdown since March 9; it took weeks after the virus first appeared here to realize that severe measures were absolutely necessary.

>According to several data scientists, Italy is about 10 days ahead of Spain, Germany, and France in the epidemic progression, and 13 to 16 days ahead of the United Kingdom and the United States.

When you consider where to go, how to protect yourself, and what you are willing to give up to slow the spread of this virus - imagine you are the highest risk person in your community you can think of.   The grandmother a few streets over that raises her grandchildren. She needs to go out to get groceries, diapers or medicine.  She will need to go out in 2 weeks time too.  You play a major part in controlling the risk to her!   If the healthy, strong and brave do not social distance, in two weeks our nation will be as it is in Italy or worse.  Your neighbor will be walking through a minefield to get the supplies she needs to survive.   If we can all make sacrifices now then that minefield is far less frightening for everyone.    The sooner we distance and the more we do so, the greater chance your neighbor gets to raise her grandchildren.


I'm sure you've all seen articles about why we must flatten the curve.  Please consider it from the perspective of your neighbors that are not as lucky as you to be in a low risk group or from the viewpoint of our healthcare professions.  There will be brave doctors and nurses who will be leaving retirement to provide the care our nation needs.  There will be young healthcare professionals just out of school working overtime with faces raw from the masks and googles they wear.  They are the soldiers in this war.  They are putting themselves on the line for us.   When you aid this virus in spreading, you are putting extra bullets in the air - exponentially more bullets perhaps.  We need to keep the spread low enough to give these brave men and women a fighting chance.  

Respect and love for these brave doctors and for the high risk neighbors is what we need.  Collectively we control the number if bullets in the air and mines in the minefields of this war.

Let's support each other as we show compassion by cancelling the fun outings we've been planning.  This is war time, those things will wait.  If we are willing to put aside our valued social gatherings today, many more neighbors will get to join in the celebration tomorrow.

I'm a travel respiratory therapist in Colorado. My hospital is not handling anything appropriately. 


We are screened at the beginning of every shift. It's filling out a form with questions; do you have a fever/cough/etc.

There are not enough N95 masks, so they are only allowed to be used with patients who are already 100% confirmed COVID+. And they are all hidden and hard to find. 

As everyone knows tests can take up for 4 days to result...
So say patient Jane Doe comes in with all the textbook symptoms and is negative for influenza A/B and RSV. We are not allowed to use a mask on this patient until the COVID test comes back as positive. So now for 4 days every RN, MD, CNA, PT, OT, RT, dietary, housekeeper, lab, etc. has come into Jane's room WITH NO MASK. And they are passing it on to other patients! 

We also cannot use the same mask for every room due to cross contamination. We leave the mask in the room and use it each time we need to go in. 

Today at the beginning of shift I knew of 2 positive COVIDs on my unit. At the end of my shift there were 3 more. The 3 new ones, I had been in their rooms all day today without a mask because the COVID results didn't come back until today around 4:00 PM.

Now I'm likely a carrier and passing it around to other patients like every other staff member. This is pathetic. 

Does anyone know who/where I can report this, or if I should? Local news? With me being BRAND new to this area and this is a brand new contract to me I am very scared of the repercussions of ""telling"" on the facility as I cannot support my family without a job.  

Any advice to calm my anxiety would be welcome. I'm sorry if this post is scattered.

Edit: so other staff are apparently also upset and management has been trying to ""fix things"" whatever that entails. I'll see where things go Monday morning and go from there.

Then it will be all over in 2 months.

For places necessary to be open like groceries, everyone working there should be required to wear masks provided by the company at all times (even if re-usable, washable cotton or polyurethane masks) as well as keeping 6 feet distance with the customers. And all the customers in the store should be forced to keep a 6 feet distance at all times between other customers as well (as well as the workers). And this enforcement should be actually enforced by multiple police officers in the building.

But if they only do partial shutdowns instead of a complete one, and if they don't enforce the mask and 6 feet rule, it's going to drag on forever.

My husband got sick first.  It started with a slight sore throat and headache, the next day it turned into a fever of 103 with a cough and body aches and by the third day the cough was worse along with the fever and body aches.  On the third day he threw up 3-4 times in four hours even though he did have an empty stomach besides ibuprofen and Tylenol.   It’s about the 10-11th day and he’s still coughing even though he’s getting better.

I got sick two days later and for me it stayed off with sore throat and the next day I had a low fever, chills, headache and body aches.  I never got the cough.  It slowly started getting better for me and I feel pretty normal with the exception of a few body aches and fatigue.  

My four year old started off with a high fever of 104 and the fever comes and goes.  He also got the cough and a slightly runny nose.

My five year old also tested positive and he showed no symptoms until 4pm today when he got a temp of 100.4.  Gave him Tylenol and he got better and now his temp went up to 102 and I gave him more Tylenol.

ffmrku,CoronavirusUS,A physician concerned - the medical community is not prepared.,3/9/2020 9:18,"  

We are underprepared and the lack of guidance is truly harrowing. Our infectious disease training in medical school is limited to taxonomic classification of communicable disease including viral and bacterial infections. We learn treatment modalities and algorithmic based protocols to treat these disease in the ill. But we lack educational initiatives that would plan us for disaster relief, pandemics and global threats that we are all too often exposed to. There are few medical schools, \[one that I graduated from,\] that focus on these issues and prepare us to help with public health crises. 

Let me be clear; the hospital systems across the Unites States are neither equipped nor trained to deal with an influx of COVID-19 patients. We will treat the ill like all other patients. Droplet precautions in the emergency room and continued through hospitalization. Nursing staff may be more attentive wearing the protective gear that are often otherwise neglected. Critical care units and respiratory therapists will continue bag-mask ventilation during intubation of severe respiratory disease (despite being advised against). But this is standard procedure in non-standard situations. 

The hospital where I am completing my fellowship has 120 critical care beds (between the neuro ICU, CVICU, CCU, SICU, etc). But they will be overwhelmed. We cover the entire eastern NC, east of I95. Health care workers will be sick. We won’t wear the mandatory body suits seen in photos in Chinese hospitals. We will be short-staffed and spreaders of he disease. Specialty physicians will be scarce. We will overburden the emergency room physicians with patients that should be seen at special triage clinics. 

The implications of our ignorance is clear. It is likely that every American will know someone that died. When the dust settles, we will talk about it like the 1918 flu pandemic. We will receive annual corona vaccines with the flu vaccine and despite that, we will still expect a high annual mortality similar to the annual flu. And perhaps, just perhaps, we will use this as a learning opportunity to finally reform healthcare.",175,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/ffmrku/a_physician_concerned_the_medical_community_is/

Failure to do so would mean you are letting kids go to school when its been determined that conditions are unsafe.

fe0fw7,CoronavirusUS,It’s not widely known a rash IS a symptom of COVID19,3/6/2020 3:21,"At least, it is one of the possible symptoms. Hello, I thought in the spirit of helping others stay informed, especially those with community outbreak, I would share what I know. 

I am family to one of the Utah couples who were quarantined in the diamond princess off the coast of Japan in Feb, John and Melanie (you may have heard of them from the news). I’ve noticed a few posts from members in areas of known outbreak asking about a rash being a symptom of Covid19. I would like to confirm that while it hasn’t been as widely published, this is in fact a symptom.

John got a rash while aboard the diamond princess when his flu-like symptoms began. The rash was like red sores, no blistering and no pain as he didn’t notice until he looked in the mirror. It was accompanied with a high fever and some nausea with no appetite. Contrary to popular symptoms, John did not have a cough. He later tested positive for the coronavirus and was treated at a Japanese hospital. 

His wife Melanie was taken to the Travis AFB for her quarantine. She confirmed that the CDC there informed them that a rash is one of the symptoms to look for with COVID19 as they were monitoring themselves during their quarantine. 

I am not sure why the rash hasn’t been more widely included in articles released about COVID19 symptoms but I would like everyone to be informed as to what they should look for if they are concerned they may have contracted the virus. 

As in John’s case, he did not have the typical symptom of a cough. He did have a rash and high fever and nausea. Pneumonia developed about a week later after the other symptoms had improved. Just because you don’t have a cough or have a less common symptom like a rash it doesn’t not mean you don’t have COVD19. Be informed so that you can get tested when appropriate so you don’t spread it, especially to those who are high risk. 

I hope this was helpful.

I haven't been sick except for a very minor cold in 5 years. I have never had bronchitis or any other lung problem. I waited until my appendix burst to go to ER years ago, I tend to ignore not feeling well., I am not over reacting, imagining this or exaggerating .  Was a smoker for many years quit years ago.  

Started 2 days ago. Just being tired and not feeling well. Last night my lungs and bronchial tubes hurt, felt raw. Shortness of breath which I have never had before. Got up today, felt a little better. About an hour ago lungs started hurting again, spiked a low fever, my joints hurt, no shortness of breath but my chest is very tight.

This is concerning because I have only been out the few times to make short grocery store runs, the store wasn't very busy, no crowding, picked up my stuff from the shelves and paid with a card, no cash (to catch it from).  I have had contact with no one but the cashier.

So if I got it from those trips in my very rural area, it is EVERYWHERE. I assume my immune system will kill it.  There is no where to report it on the web. You would think the gov would have set up something.  

Does anyone know if there is a reporting site? Or one in the process of being set up?

Edit:  to add information.
This is a completely thing from the regular flu. I once had a really bad cough as a kid, lasted for weeks my bronchial tubes got sore. It's like that PLUS  my lungs feel raw, like a sore throat. There is also chest soreness like someone hit me hard enough to bruise.
I can see why people with restricted lung function do to age or illness  are having trouble. It feels like I am using some of back and stomach muscles to take the deeper breaths I know I need. I normally only take 8 breaths per minute I have been doing12-16. But the feeling like I can't get a deep breath is gone.

They should be shamed, dishonored, and this should be seen as a complete and utter failing by our government.

It has been proven that early treatment (before the onset of severe symptoms) gives the best recovery and prevents the illness from progressing to severe stages. 
How can we treat these people ourselves? We have to! They give us no other choice than just lay down and die, and hope for the best! This is unacceptable! 

We must be proactive. We must get informational resources together,  and we should take action. Real action. You can use Nextdoor to communicate with your neighbors.

fjx1cj,CoronavirusUS,3 reasons why the US will be hit worse than China and Italy with the coronavirus.,3/17/2020 10:00,"Sorry for the click-bait title, but hear me out.

&#x200B;

1)  [Testing.](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-many-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-have-been-completed)

China and, to a lesser degree, Italy were much, much more aggressive with testing starting much earlier in their outbreaks than the US.  This is critical if a country has any chance of containing the spread of the virus.  Look to Hong Kong, [South Korea](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/opinions/south-korea-italy-coronavirus-survivability-sepkowitz/index.html), and Taiwan for examples of proper containment of the spread of the virus.  The US has done the opposite.  This means that media reports on the [number of cases in the US is drastically under reported.](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/scientists-find-86-percent-coronavirus-infections-go-unreported/)  It's not the media's fault.  [The CDC dropped the ball.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html)  The bottom line is that the US infection rate is likely an order of magnitude or more higher than our numbers show.

2)  Response

Wuhan went on lock down on [Jan 23](https://web.archive.org/web/20200123012628/https://www.nytimes.com/) when there were about 400 confirmed cases.

Northern Italy went on lock down around [Feb 22](https://www.france24.com/en/20200222-first-coronavirus-death-in-europe-sends-italian-towns-into-lockdown) with around 79 confirmed cases and the first deaths were occurring.

The US, at the time of this writing has over 4500 confirmed cases (don't forget, the US has been doing very few tests per capita) and 87 deaths.  Sure, the US population is much larger, but New York City, for example, has over 950 confirmed cases and Washington state is over 750.  And as of today these places still are not on lock down!

3)  Medical capacity

[The US has less hospital beds per capita than China or Italy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds)

US:  2.77 beds/1000 people

Italy:  3.18 beds/1000 people

China:  4.34 beds/1000 people

This matters because in [China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-patients-in-wuhan-face-a-health-system-past-the-brink-11581084599) and in [Italy](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/not-a-wave-a-tsunami-italy-hospitals-at-virus-limit), the hospitals became so overwhelmed that patients were forced to wait in hallways as hospitals became completely overwhelmed.  Even with their larger capacity, [China built an emergency hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/feb/03/coronavirus-china-completes-emergency-hospital-build-in-eight-days-video-timelapse) in order to manage the crisis.  The US is less prepared for the influx of coronavirus patients than China or Italy, and will likely have a much larger peak of sick people than either country, due to the reasons explained above.

By going to the store in mass droves we are only adding to the problem, by not practicing social distancing. By increasing foot traffic in stores, we increase the risk of getting grocery workers sick, getting warehouse workers sick, and the people who get you your food and supplies. 

The best way to keep the supply chain going, is to keep washing hands and staying home as much as possible. Reduce the risk of the people getting sick who stock the shelves, work in distribution and so on. 

Please don't hoard, please keep in mind that those shelves are not stocked by robots. They are humans who can get sick.

Maybe I am missing something, and I will try to update if things are taking different turn. But if other warehouses look like the one I'm in. Things will be fine as long as the workers don't get sick. So just stay home!




Edit: To say, get food and eat healthy, but don't be greedy. Maybe grab an extra bag of rice or pasta. Get what u need for a month, if u are at a higher risk for getting sick/high risk pre-existing conditions and become/are quatintined be prepared. Please just consider your fellow human.

The airport was nuts.",3/15/2020 22:11,"My little family had to leave Belgium because there was fear that the government would close the borders. The Belgian airport workers didn't know if we would be allowed to fly. Seems like there is some general confusion after Trump's proclamation. 

Dulles was a mess. When we got to the airport, they continued to pack more and more people on a tram. It was standing room only. Lots of coughing and sneezing. 

When I complained because:
1. I have an infant who will have to go to the ER if she gets sick

2. My husband's coworker in his small office was lab-confirmed for coronavirus

They said distancing was only a ""recommendation"", and they weren't required to follow the protocols.

They ended up taking us off the tram for a health screening. The CDC asked if we had been to China and took our temps. They then put us back on...you guessed it--an overcrowded tram. I refused to get on it. We waited hours. They argued and dismissed everything we were saying. One guy said we would become ""property of Customs and Border Patrol"" if we didn't get on the tram.

Finally a nice CBP officer helped us get to customs without going on a crowded tram and got us through the line at customs. I'm not trying to be alarmist, but I thought it was ridiculous how no one was following protocol. I wanted to keep my infant safe as well as others since we had been exposed.

My husband is an epidemiologist, and while he said the airport isn't the best place to contain disease, he thought it was shocking how they were not screening people and were stuffing people together on the tram and in line.

It was such a mess, and I was kind of a bitch. But this was insane. So many more people are getting exposed.",134,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fj1vdr/social_distancing_a_recommendation_not_a/

It can stay in the air and be inhaled. It can also move with the wind and come to you and then be inhaled. It's really not rocket science to understand that wearing a mask SIGNIFICANTLY reduces chances of you inhaling this viral particle as it flies through the air. --> THESE, are universally known facts. i.e. You don't have to be a doctor or Coronavirus scientist to know this.

If your mask is a normal surgical mask, you get a decent protection compared to wearing nothing. If your mask is N95, you get SIGNIFICANTLY higher protection against the virus since N95 filter 95% of particulates. N99 masks are even more protective than N95s. --> THESE, are universally known facts. i.e. You don't have to be a rocket scientist or Coronavirus knower to know this.

What I don't understand is this --> Why, on earth, U.S Media, and I mean EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM from CNN to FOX and all those in between, constantly and continously day & night been promoting to the poor American people that ""MASKS DONT WORK"", ""DONT WEAR MASK"", I've even seen headlines such as ""WEARING MASKS INCREASE YOUR CHANCE OF GETTING VIRUS"". Can anyone tell me why on earth U.S & its media is promoting these nonsense? Shouldn't those who distribute this nonsense be criminally prosecuted for the grieve damage they cause to many lives telling people to go unprotected when faced with an aerosol breathable virus?

Just look at China.. In Hubei province for example if you don't wear a mask police will arrest you. In Hong Kong or Singapore government is giving free supply of daily masks & sanitizers to people and everyone wears mask. What exactly is going on in America? If they ""Forgot"" to tell Americans to wear mask, I wouldn't be as pissed as now that they actively tell Americans ""DO NOT WEAR MASK"" !!!?!

fjm18j,CoronavirusUS,CORONA VIRUS - experience in Italy - feel free to ask.,3/16/2020 22:44,"Hi all, 

First, I want to say sorry if my english is not perfect, I used to speak and write better english but now I lost fluency and vocabulary.

I am Italian, I live in Italy, and I'm in Italy right now and I've been here for the past 4 years. I want to share my experience with people abroad, especially in the USA,  because I think that reading news papers and watching tv might do not give the idea of how we are living this situation. 

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: I'm not a doctor nor a virologist nor a nurse. I'm just a regular Italian in quarantine.

This is how the perception of the problem evolved:

At the beginning the majority of people thought it was a Chinese problem. People were afraid of Chinese looking people. We will never know how Covid 19 came to Italy but the 20th of February we had the first known patient with corona virus hospitalized in the north of Italy, Lombardy. From that moment on the number of cases started to increase day after day, now ( March 16th 2020) we have around 24.700 cases ( this number includes healed and dead people).

Italians were first sceptical, than scared, than ""oh, it's just a regular flu, then scared again. We received a lot of schizophrenic messages from our media, and we couldn't understand how serious the situation was, but in the meantime the health system of Lombardy ( the best in the country) was collapsing, and a lot of people were getting infected all over the country . because people were going out for dinner, drinks , were moving for work or holiday etc..

I'm not going to tell you all the legal steps taken by our Prime Minister but remember those dates 20th feb and 16th march ( today). From 1 case in Lombardy to 24.700 cases in Italy. 

Remember also that the whole territory is under quarantine from March the 8th.

Basically we have to stay at home all time. We're only allowed to go out for food, emergencies, or necessities ( that means for eg. walk the dog, go to the pharmacy, or other necessities that may be verified by the police). It's hard, we are Italians, we love going out, staying with friends, hug and kiss everybody, we are hard workers too ( even if some english experts of my ass doesn't think so), we're artisans, chefs, movie people, bartenders, teachers and so on. It's hard. It is hard to explain to our children why they cannot go to school, nor even go play in the park with friends. But we are doing this for the safety of other human lives.  And for our doctors and nurses who work non stop, exposing themselves to the virus every day.

I have my opinions and my doubts on the misuse of this corona virus, but I've decided to accept the rules and to stay at home.

Please, be careful, this virus will arrive everywhere. Do not panic, do not underestimate the problem, wash you hands, keep distance in public places, sanitise you belongings, clean your house, protect the weakest, spread the word.

If you have any question that I can answer, please feel free to ask.

Good luck",127,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fjm18j/corona_virus_experience_in_italy_feel_free_to_ask/

fbp06c,CoronavirusUS,Coworkers think I'm overreacting about stocking up on food and essentials. Here's the reason everyone should.,3/1/2020 12:38,"When I tell my coworkers I've stocked up for at least a month, and they should too, here's the responses I get:

1. It's just like the Flu.
2. Way more people die from the Flu than Coronavirus.
3. It's like having a bad cold.
4. Only elderly people die from it.
5. Etc., etc.

So to start, no, I don't think this is an apocalypse. I don't think there's going to be riots and looting. However, I tried making the following points and they don't seem to be taking it serious:

1. By stocking up on non-perishables, food, water, medicine, etc., I'm making it so that when it DOES spread, I won't have to interact with people in large crowded areas. The CDC has already said it's not a matter of if, but when. I want as little interaction with potential sick people as possible.

2. Even if the majority of people dying are elderly, if you get it, you can easily spread it to elderly people yourself. Would you be okay knowing you gave it your Grandmother and she passed away?

3. Even if the symptoms are mild in younger people, why the hell would I put myself in a scenario that increases my chances of getting it? Okay, so I may not die from it. But I'd rather, you know... NOT get the coronavirus to begin with. 

4. When people start panic buying, they're going to buy all the good food. Everyone has to eat. If you know you're going to eat daily like every other person on this earth, why not stock up ahead of time and ride this out? Even if the predictions are overblown, you're going to eat the food.

There's literally no reason not to prepare ahead of time. It's mind blowing how many people are taking this lightly. I'm not panicking at all. I'm not even scared. I know some people are, and that's fine. But I'd rather be prepared than wait last minute and have to deal with the consequences.",110,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fbp06c/coworkers_think_im_overreacting_about_stocking_up/

For others, you might be closer and it might be a big story on local news in WA, CA, and NY.

My parents have been in the process of drafting up their will and are in their 60's. They're using a lawyer friend down the street they've known for three decades or more. They've been at his office multiple times and just signed the final documents earlier this week.

Turns out the lawyer's daughter, whom I remember just as the younger girl down the street growing up, moved across the country to Seattle and her roommate (and best friend) is on the front lines as nurse specifically in Kirkland, Washington. Her mom (the lawyer's wife) was visiting them in Kirkland just days ago and in heavy contact with this nurse.

I basically told my parents to sign whatever they need to sign and get it done so they don't have to go back. This lady could very easily bring it back on a plane to PA, infect her husband (the lawyer), and then pass it along to tons of law clients (such as my parents).

Stay safe out there folks. You're likely six or less people away from someone directly in contact with the virus, even if you're across the country.",113,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fdw6zl/six_degrees_of_separation_first_encounter_closer/

If people stopped going to bars, they'd be forced to close.",3/16/2020 2:33,"Among the staff, some have second jobs as nurses and one works at a nursing home. I get that a lot of people want to make the most of their sudden vacation time, but please don't consider yourself an exception or make exceptions for your social distancing, most restaurants are promising they're letting sick employees take off but not all of them are holding to that promise, it's just for show.

Social distancing means social distancing, and just because you're too drunk to care about any of it in the moment doesn't mean what you're doing isn't harmful. It's hard because many restaurant workers can't risk quitting, but they're also very scared and stressed and don't want to be there, so the best case scenario for them is if they're forced to close without losing their jobs, which will only happen if the government enforces it or people stop coming to bars. Please, if nothing else please be respectful and don't come to bars if you're sick or have been around sick people, and ideally don't come at all to show solidarity for the people who are forced to be exposed to countless (often unhygienic due to being impaired) crowds of people every day. Some of these people will go on to interact with your loved ones, many of them have second jobs in healthcare which we need more than ever now, please don't make them sick just because you can't handle waiting a few weeks to get wasted and slobber/puke all over everything.",107,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fj5zun/a_bar_in_my_area_refuses_to_close_until_theyre/

I'm going to go through some of the old data, and take into account some of the new data about spread coming from the USA and draw some conclusions. It's a long read. If you are looking for alarmist headlines and a lack of scientific data to fuel your doom and gloom outlook on the situation, please look elsewhere.

I'm going through some studies and news articles and I'm translating the pertinent information into what is hopefully plain and simple English that someone can understand without having some kind of a degree.

I'm drawing my conclusions at the end.

**Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study**

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30086-4/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30086-4/fulltext)

The study’s aim was to provide descriptions of CT scans taken at different points during the disease.

Patients chosen for the study were tested for COVID-19 with RT-PCR or with next generation sequencing.

(Two different ways of checking to see if the patient has the virus)

They chose patients who had received multiple CT scans while they had the virus.

They discovered that COVID-19 pneumonia causes abnormalities in CT scans of the lungs, even in patients without symptoms.

They concluded that CT scans of the lungs would be a good way to diagnose patients with COVID-19.

They found that all parts of the lungs can be involved, but the lower right lobe was slightly more often showing the abnormalities on the scan.

They described several abnormalities on the CT scans. 65% of patients had ground-glass opacity. 81% of patients had ill-defined margins. 35% had smooth or irregular interlobular septal thickening. 47% had air bronchogram. 10% had crazy-paving pattern. 32% had thickening of the adjacent pleura.

The ground glass opacity was more common in CT scans that were done within 1 week of the symptoms starting. And it diminished with time while the other irregularities increased.

They also noted a previous study, which stated the virus causes lower respiratory tract symptoms more than upper respiratory ones, so it most likely somehow targets the cells in the lower respiratory tract. Which matched what was seen on the CT scans.

The authors did point out that there were 15 cases of asymptomatic illness discovered by CT scans being done and recommended testing people who were likely to have been exposed so they could be caught earlier on before the disease progressed. The authors were not clear on if these cases developed symptoms later or not.

The disease presentation on CT scans of the lungs increased within the first 2 weeks of onset of symptoms and then slowly decreased within the third week.

For the most part, the patients had both lungs affected.

The conclusion of the study was basically that we can use CT scans to diagnose patients with illness.

**Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study**

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30079-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30079-5/fulltext)

It’s important to note that this study **only** focuses on **critically ill** patients. So any numbers are going to be inflated from the actual totals for infection fatality rate and case fatality rate.

There were 710 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in total. The 509 who were admitted after January 12, too late to be included in the numbers, were excluded.

201 were remaining. 146 were excluded because they were just getting oxygen therapy by inhaling a gas solution that was less than 60% oxygen and were not considered in serious need of oxygen therapy.

Of the remaining 55 patients who were being treated in the ICU, 3 were basically excluded because they died during or right after admission.

This study looked at the remaining 52 critically ill adult patients. The patients had all been in a hospital in Wuhan between late December 2019 and January 26, 2020. They compared data for those who survived and those who died. They also followed up again on February 9th to check which patients were still alive and which had died.

The median age of patients was about 59 years old.

The median duration from admission to ICU and death was 7 days for those who died.

67% of patients were men. 21% had chronic illness. 98% developed fever. 61% had died within 28 days.

Non survivors were older compared to survivors. The median age was about 64. The non survivors were more likely to develop ARDS and more likely to receive ventilation either invasively or non-invasively.

Most of the critically ill patients had organ function damage. 67% had ARDS, 29% had acute kidney injury, 23% had heart injury, 29% had irregular liver function and 2% had pneumothorax. A total of 71% of critically ill patients required mechanical ventilation. About 13% of the critically ill patients acquired hospital infection (meaning they caught other bugs during their stay in the hospital, probably because their lungs were more susceptible to getting secondary infection).

Here is a list of symptoms by percentage of all study participants and a list of comorbidities.

Symptoms (rounded up to closest percentage)

· 98% had a fever

· 77% had a cough

· 64% had difficulty breathing

· 12% had muscle pain

· 12% had general feelings of unwellness

· 6% had a stuffy nose

· 2% had joint pain

· 2% had chest pain

· 2% had headache

· 4% had vomiting

Comorbidities (other conditions they either had or developed – the authors didn’t specify if these were pre-existing conditions or not)

· 67% ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)

· 23% cardiac injury

· 29% liver dysfunction

· 35% hyperglycemia

· 12% ended up getting hospital acquired pneumonia (meaning they got pneumonia causing bacteria in their lungs that they caught while in hospital, also known as a secondary infection)

What I found interesting was that the study authors went on to say that the mortality rate of the critically ill patients was higher than with SARS or MERS. Even though they were just looking at critical cases of COVID-19 and not the overall case fatality rate.

In this study on COVID-19, 62% of critically ill patients had died at 28 days. A total of 71% had required mechanical ventilation and a total of 67% had ARDS.

In studies on critically ill patients with SARS, approximately 43% of patients had died at 28 days. A total of 76% required mechanical ventilation.

The authors even went on to say that they postulated that the mortality rate would be higher than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV if they extended the follow up period beyond 28 days. However, my own note here would be that the mortality rate of MERS-CoV is around 34%, however that seems to be for all cases as opposed to just critical cases.

**Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts**

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30074-7/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30074-7/fulltext)

This one is just based on hypothetical numbers, and not on known variables so it is highly subjective. They ran about 1000 different scenarios with numbers that were based on different guesses and not on any actual numbers, so it's fairly useless. The key takeaway is that with a high infection rate and ineffective contact tracing, which most countries seem to be poor at, the infection will spread globally.

**Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study**

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30026-1/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30026-1/fulltext)

For this study, they leveraged a social network DXY.cn that streams news reports from local and national Chinese health agencies. They made a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China.

They also made list of international cases of COVID-19 that had not been caused by person to person spread but from someone being infected in China and going to another country, from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities.

This is most likely the first study that uses crowdsourced data from social media sources to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak.

The median age of patients who had died was determined to be 70 years of age. Only 3% of patients that died were younger than 15 years of age.

They determined that several provinces outside of Hubei had sustained local transmission.

The median delay between onset of symptoms and seeking treatment was 2 days after the awareness of the virus had increased.

Based on 33 cases of people who contracted the virus in Wuhan and then travelled elsewhere, they were able to determine that the median incubation period for the virus was about 5 days.

They did note that they found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups. However, they did also note that much of their data is based on travellers, who are predominantly adult, and because their patients were captured by the healthcare system, the results could be biased because they are more likely to be counting more severe cases a opposed to all cases in general.

They noted there is a strong association between chronic health conditions and the severity of COVID-19 infection.

They noted a previous case study where the adults of a household were infected, while a 10 year old child remained symptom free.

They noted that they had less information from Wuhan and Hubei, most likely due to the healthcare systems there being overwhelmed at the time of the study.

They also have an over-representation of travel related cases as initially the testing criteria required travel to Wuhan before the criteria were relaxed and the medical system started testing anyone with symptoms.

Please note here, again, the numbers are likely inflated because they are focusing on cases the healthcare system flagged which can't possibly include all cases, especially not milder ones.

This study did not try to calculate the reproductive number, however they mentioned a previous study had estimated it at between 2.5 and 2.7 based on the number of internationally imported cases before there was a massive intervention in Wuhan (the travel bans, etc).

They got data from a total of 507 patients. The median age was 46 years of age. No patients were younger than 35 or older than 60.

55% of patients were male. 40% were female. And 5% did not have gender listed on the report.

72% were in mainland China, 26% were in Beijing, 17% were in Shaanxi, 8% were in Hubei, 4% were in Tianjin, 4% were in Yunnan, 28% were cases reported outside of mainland China.

30% had visited Wuhan, 30% lived in Wuhan, 16% had no connection to Wuhan and 24% had no data on whether there was connection to Wuhan for the infection.

At the time of reporting, the disease outcome was an 8% case fatality rate.

**How deadly is the new coronavirus? Data from the spread of US cases could help answer that.**

[https://www.livescience.com/how-deadly-is-coronavirus-covid-19.html](https://www.livescience.com/how-deadly-is-coronavirus-covid-19.html)

This is a news article that drew my attention. They noted that genetic analysis of the virus circulating on the west coast of the United States indicated that it has been spreading there for at least 6 weeks before being detected. That means it’s been spreading in the region since January. This is alarming because it means that the disease went undetected in the USA since the middle of January. Which was probably before the USA and local health authorities even suspected that they had anything to be on the lookout for. This will probably be the same for many other countries which now have person to person spread. This was attributed to the lack of test kits, only testing those with frequent travel history, and 81% of cases being mild and therefore not being reported to health authorities.

**Summary of a Report of 72 314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention**

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130)

This is probably the most important summary of what we know up to date about the virus.

The study this article references went through 72 314 Cases (as of February 11, 2020).

62% of cases are confirmed cases, 22% of cases are suspected cases, 15% are diagnosed cases and 1% are asymptomatic cases.

For the age distribution of cases, 1% of cases were younger than 10 years of age. 1% of cases were between 10-19 years of age, 8% of cases were 20-29 years of age, 87% of cases were 30-79 years of age and 3% of cases were in those 80 years of age or older.

For the disease spectrum (how sick people were), 81% of cases were mild. This means that 81% of cases did not require medical treatment and resolve without intervention. Mild cases included infections without pneumonia and infections with only mild pneumonia. 14% of cases were severe and 5% of cases were critical.

The case fatality rate was 2.3%. However, for patients older than 80 years of age the case fatality rate was 14.8%. And for patients aged 70-79 years of age the case fatality rate was 8%.

**Now I’m going to draw my conclusion based on the data**

COVID-19 is going to spread. And it's here to stay. That's a given at this point.

After all the work I just put into getting all the data, interpreting the information from the studies and even listing the shortcomings of the studies and how they could be inaccurate, I’m now going to draw my conclusion here. If anyone wants to try to fight me by posting alarmist misinformation that they can’t back up with links to actual studies and news articles, you will be ignored because I’m sick of hearing it. And I'm tired of people reading studies and selectively misunderstanding the information or cherry picking information that sounds worst case scenario and taking it out of context.

First, I want to put an end to much of the alarmism that points out the case fatality rate. I think many online are mistaking the case fatality rate for the infection fatality rate. This is a huge mistake. If the case fatality rate is 2.3%, that does by no means conclude that 2.3% of people who catch the virus are going to die. This is just the fatality rate for cases. We don’t know the actual number of infections, however, based on the information coming out of the west coast of the USA, we have just learned that the virus was being transmitted and wasn’t being detected for 6 weeks. Which means that there are probably thousands upon thousands of infections that were never counted in China before the spread of the virus was acknowledged. And there are probably hundreds, if not thousands of uncounted cases internationally where those who were infected with the virus showed no symptoms. There is no way the virus could have spread for 6 weeks undetected in the US if suddenly everyone and their dog started dying of ARDS. Which would have started about 4 to 5 weeks ago based on the other numbers if the virus was here that long and had a higher mortality rate.

In addition, the official case fatality rate includes people who have pre-existing conditions and the very old. If you eliminate those factors, you probably have below a 0.5% case fatality rate for a healthy adult.

Now, if you also account for the number of infections in children, which are probably contracting it at the same rate as adults and not showing any symptoms for the most part, that means that this rate is even lower, as there are hardly any cases of children showing symptoms being counted in the numbers, however there are certainly infected children, or children being exposed to the pathogen and not developing illness.

In addition, because most testing so far internationally has focused specifically on symptomatic cases, cases who frequently traveled to infected regions, or close contacts (meaning that the patient lives with someone who has the virus, by most countries definitions of close contact) we are not going to have a lot of asymptomatic cases testing positive, because we just aren’t looking there. Look at the cases that got missed on the west coast of the USA that were spreading for 6 weeks.

So, if anything, the actual infection mortality rate, which is something we would only be able to calculate if we had all the data, which we will never have, is probably even significantly lower than the case fatality rate.

I don’t think that we shouldn’t be taking this seriously. We should be taking measures to limit exposure to vulnerable populations, such as those who have chronic health conditions and those over a certain age. We should be doing more testing to get an accurate picture of the disease spread and progression. We should do something that everyone seems to have stopped doing – stay home from work when you get sick so that you don’t spread it around.

People in general probably don’t need to be wearing masks. What we should do though is the opposite. People with symptoms should wear masks out of common courtesy for other people if they are not able to stay at home to reduce their risk of infecting others.

We should be washing and sanitizing our hands.

What we should not be doing is having a stock market crushing panic about a disease that targets old and vulnerable members of the population. I’m going to sound cold here, but people who are in poor health dying (the sick and the elderly) when stuff goes wrong, isn’t exactly outside of the course of the human experience by a long shot.

All that we really need to do is try to increase the amount of oxygen therapy and ventilation equipment available in hospitals for the percentage of cases that do get bad. And we need to take some small steps to try to eliminate unnecessary transmission.

And as much as I hate to say it, despite some companies boasting about vaccines and treatments, in the earlier study I listed, many of the severely ill patients were given antiviral therapy, however based on the CT scants, there’s a chance it might even have contributed to morbidity in some cases by damaging the liver. And in reality, a viable vaccine that doesn’t come with horrendous risks due to the fact that we really don’t have a clear understanding of how this pathogen works and whether or not it would be effective, or whether or not antibodies for this virus remain in our system or not, is anyone’s guess. But getting the actual answers is likely to take 2 or 3 years, assuming we want to do it correctly and not create a public health risk by potentially creating a botched vaccine.

But what are we panicking about here? I keep seeing this compared to the Spanish flu. However, the Spanish flu tended to knock down people in the prime of their lives. This is a different beast.

Yes, some healthy people are going to die. But everyone is panicking about this right now. Panic clouds judgment and that prevents us from putting it into perspective.

79,535 deaths occur every year due to diabetes in the USA.

Globally, about 10 million people die of cancer every year. You don’t see the stock market tanking because everyone is dying of cancer.

647,000 Americans die from heart disease every year.

Let’s assume a worst-case scenario. If the entire population of the USA caught the virus, we’d probably be looking at the case fatality rate of 2.3% and adjusting it for what we can presume the infection fatality rate is, it’s probably hovering around or below 1% just due to lack of testing and data on asymptomatic or mild cases. Let’s say the entire population of the USA got infected all at the same time, which is unlikely to occur, especially heading into the summer months, assuming the USA has a population of 328 million, we’d be looking at maybe 3,280,000 deaths.

And that’s assuming everyone gets it. As we adapt to the new threat and start taking coughs and symptoms more seriously, and people finally start actually not showing up to work when they’re sick and assuming we start treating and diagnosing cases at a faster rate, we’re probably looking at 328,000 total deaths in the USA before a vaccine gets developed, and most of those deaths are going to be in people above the age of 60. And another large portion of those deaths are going to be in people above 80. This is going to be lower than the deaths caused by heart disease. The stock market isn’t shutting down due to heart disease is it? We aren’t quarantining cities and stopping production because people are catching cancer, which is probably actually more directly caused by manufacturing than any other condition.

People aren’t panic buying aspirin because 647,000 people this year might have a heart attack.

So that’s me going through all the data and drawing realistic, non-alarmist conclusions.

If anyone comments with any baseless doom and gloom claims, I’m ignoring them. The numbers I looked at above are based on smaller samples of the total numbers and primarily on the worst cases and represent an inflated total. They give the case fatality rate, which is always going to be higher than the infection fatality rate, because the numbers are always going to be biased due to study limitations.

The only real problem that I can see with this thing is the reproductive rate. Because it’s high, it has the capacity to overwhelm the medical system when all the cases start to show up at once after a new rash of infections in an area. But that will eventually die down as well as we move toward rapid identification and treatment and change how we handle symptoms of illness in general.

I just put in like 40 hours of effort to source through everything and come up with some sane conclusions. It’s not just the flu, bro. But it’s no heart disease or cancer.",105,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fdayeb/my_conclusion_covid19_will_spread_globally_but_we/

*A letter from Italy:*
 
 We live in Italy - Milan,
 I'm going to share with you and explain to you, ""How is life here in Milan"" during these difficult days and how do I think you should learn from the mistakes and their consequences that we live here.
 We are currently in quarantine.  We don't take to the streets, the police are in constant motion and arrest anyone outside his home.

 Everything is closed!  ... business, malls, stores, all streets without movement. Feeling of the end of the world !!

 It is a fact that I never thought I would ever live!
 People are confused, sad, anxious and helpless, and often do not understand how this reality was imposed on them and when this whole nightmare will end.

 *The big mistake was that at the start of the first hit people continued to lead their lives as usual and took to the streets for work, entertainment and feeling like a vacation period, so gatherings with friends and banquets abound.*
 *Everyone was wrong and so were you!*

 *I beg you, be careful, this is neither a laugh nor a joke!!!!!*

 Protect your loved ones, your parents, and your grandparents!  The disease is dangerous for them.
 About 200 people die here every day, *not because medicine in Milan is not good (it's one of the best in the world), but rather because there are no places for everyone!*

 *Doctors choose who will die!*  

*This is only because of the silliness of the citizens at the beginning, who decided to continue their lives as usual, regardless of the new situation!*

 Please, learn from the mistakes, we are a small country that could end up with a great tragedy.

*Listen well now 🙏*

 *Don't go out into crowded places.*
 *Try not to eat in public places.*
  *Stay longer at home during this time!*
 *Listen to the Ministry of Health guidelines (don't play it!).*
  *Talk about a meter away from each person, do not come close, do not cuddle or accept.*

 Get a complementary and preventive treatment and learn from others' mistakes.
 *We recommend that you take vitamin C to boost your immune system*

 Helping professionals prevent the spread of the epidemic ...

In Italy, the entire country is isolated, meaning 60 million people in quarantine !!

fjrpcc,CoronavirusUS,Governments Around the World Prioritize Saving Big Banks Over Stopping the Coronavirus,3/17/2020 4:22," Last week, stock markets had some of their [worst days since the Great Depression](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-stock-market-crash-not-stonks-20200312-l3pe7jw3dbgdbanzj2cyshk2ly-story.html) as [volatility spiked](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/heres-whats-driving-market-volatility-after-the-global-stock-rout.html). In response to this, governments around the world took swift and decisive action to aid big corporations and bailout banks. The Federal Reserve rolled out a series of new policies which will [provide U.S. banks with $5.4 trillion in new funding](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-offers-more-than-5-trillion-of-liquidity-to-quench-markets-1.1405088). Trump announced that the federal government would [purchase large quantities](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/487495-trump-says-government-will-buy-crude-oil-to-help-industry) of crude oil to bailout [U.S. oil producers hurt by low oil prices](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/oil-price-war-trigger-us-shale-defaults-financial-contagion-impact-2020-3-1028990295). The administration is also reportedly contemplating [*an $800 billion bailout*](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-payroll-tax-cut-plan-obama-stimulus-financial-crisis-comparison-2020-3-1028991408) for U.S. companies. Over the weekend, the Federal Reserve announced another bailout, [promising to buy $700 billion in assets from U.S. banks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fed-cuts-rates-zero-agrees-buy-more-bonds/5054943002/), while also lowering interest rates to 0% and taking other measures to aid big banks. The Federal Reserve also announced increased currency swaps with the central banks in Japan, Switzerland, the U.K., and Europe in the face of [a massive U.S. dollar funding shortfall](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-liquidity-markets/explainer-dollar-demand-reveals-markets-pain-point-idUSKBN210307) that has emerged due the economic downturn and the virus.

All of this is part of a larger series of coordinated economic actions by governments around the world. In Germany the government announced [a 550 billion bailout for German companies](https://news.yahoo.com/germany-unleashes-biggest-post-war-aid-package-against-134124928.html), while also promising that there was “no upper limit” should a bigger bailout be needed. Speaking on this topic, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, “we will reload our weapons if necessary.” In contrast, Germany has only allocated [€1 billion to fight Coronavirus](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germany-pledges-1-billion-to-tackle-outbreak/a-52698747). The Bank of Japan (the Japanese Central Bank), also engaged in unprecedented action, buying [101.4 billion yen ($939 million) in stock funds on Thursday](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bank-of-japan-likely-to-strengthen-stimulus-next-week/ar-BB115Gan). This was the largest outright purchase of stock funds ever by the Bank of Japan. What’s more, [economists largely agree that the Bank of Japan will significantly increase its stock buying program next week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/90-of-analysts-see-boj-adding-stimulus-over-virus-hit-survey).

Christine Lagarde, the current President of the European Central Bank and former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, called on European countries to take [“an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance” to combat the “weakened \[economic\] outlook” from the virus.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus) While governments around the world have coordinated their financial bailouts of the big banks and multinational companies, the governments of the world have done little to coordinate their response to the virus. For example, in a recent televised address, [Trump referred to the Coronavirus as a “foreign virus” and announced a travel ban on Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/europe-coronavirus-travel-ban.html). In his speech Trump tried to deflect criticism of his administration’s negligence in responding to Coronavirus, by blaming European leaders for the virus’ spread in the U.S. His argument was that they were not quick enough to ban travel from China, and therefore European travelers seeded the U.S. with the virus. In response to the ban, Gérard Araud, French Ambassador to the U.S., tweeted:

>📷[**Gérard Araud✔**@GerardAraud](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud) Trump needed a narrative to exonerate his administration from any responsibility in the crisis. The foreigner is always a good scapegoat. The Chinese has already been used. So, let’s take the European, not any European, the EU-one. Doesn’t make sense but ideologically healthy.  
[1,378](https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1237916577858813959)[9:41 PM - Mar 11, 2020](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud/status/1237916577858813959) [Twitter Ads info and privacy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256)

This blame-game is not isolated to the Trump administration. While politicians and officials in the EU like Christine Lagarde have called for unprecedented fiscal coordination in the EU, they have been unwilling to provide material and medical aid to other EU countries impact by the Coronavirus. For example, when Italy’s medical system first began to struggle with Coronavirus patients, the country requested assistance from the [Union Civil Protection Mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en), an EU Civil Protection Mechanism which has a mission to “improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters.” [Not a single EU country sent Italy any medical supplies or assistance](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/).

This in part reflects how unprepared other European countries are for this pandemic. However, it also shows deeper lack of coordination between them in this time of crisis. This includes not only the lack of sharing of medical supplies, but also the uncoordinated nature of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Countries increasingly seek to blame each other for mishandling the Coronavirus, and this is not limited to the Trump administration. For instance, [the European Union just put a 30-day ban on non-essential travel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/03/16/european-union-bans-non-essential-travel-for-at-least-30-days-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/#6d55a99b3544). While the central banks and governments of the world are coordinating a major financial bailout of the big banks and multinational companies, these same governments are also increasingly at odd with each other over how to respond to the virus.

This is not confined to Western countries. For example, Chinese state officials recently have been [spreading conspiracy theories that the US army brought the virus to Wuhan](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3075227/why-china-amplifying-conspiracy-theory-blame-america-coronavirus). This is not an isolated incident, and [Chinese state media has increasingly been pushing this narrative](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1182694.shtml)[1](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/governments-around-the-world-prioritize-saving-big-banks-over-stopping-the-coronavirus/#fn:1). This reflects the interests of the Chinese state to use this crisis to its geopolitical advantage. In fact, the pandemic has also become a site of geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China. After initially praising Xi Jinping’s response, [Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the Coronavirus](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/donald-trumps-new-coronavirus-strategy-blame-china-130892). This is the logical result of years of sharpening competition between the U.S. and China.

Even one of the few examples of international aid by governments seems to be part of this logic of crude geopolitical calculus. Recently, [China sent medical experts and medical supplies to Italy](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3074682/china-sends-team-medical-experts-gear-help-italy-fight) to aid in the fight against Coronavirus. In a related initiative, [eastern Zhejiang province in China donated masks to help overseas Chinese in Italy](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-offers-medical-aid-to-italy-to-fight-coronavirus-chinese-foreign-minister). While framed by the Chinese state as a benevolent effort to help Italy and overseas Chinese there, the reality is that this part of China’s larger geopolitical strategy. In March 2019, [Italy joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47679760). The Belt and Road Initiative is a major aspect of China’s efforts to overtake the U.S. as the leading global superpower. The right-wing in the U.S. is [acutely aware China’s maneuvers globally during this pandemic.](https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-pillsbury-american-media-chinese-intimidation)

But despite their discomfort, as the Trump administration continues to mismanage the domestic, public health, and geopolitical aspects of this pandemic, it is likely that relatively basic maneuvers by China at this time will continue to boost its geopolitical strength and influence relative to the United States.

TL;DR -Just took care of the first death of confirmed COVID positive. 
Death isn’t confirmed but may soon be on the news. 

As an ICU RN, we get to see things that are beyond the average persons comprehension. We see people at their worst, we see broken down families, hopes lost, despair,  and what we like to say organized chaos. We are there at some of the most intimate times in someone’s life, or a loved ones life. We learn to brush off those heavy  emotional weights, hold back the tears, and do our job to the best of our abilities, turn around and do it again. Life goes on, for the rest of us. 
I’ve seen many people die, a few while I was there providing cpr when docs or family members call Time of death. 
Honestly I’ve never felt regret, grief, sadness or pain. 
But with the chaos that’s going on. And now currently seeing how fast this thing is spreading first hand. We are holding our cool. The first confirmed COVID patient death happened in Michigan tonight, and my thoughts and prayers go to their family. And I have faith that everyone can remain as humane and non-hostile as possible. 
But I urge everyone. 
STAY HOME, STAY AWAY FROM OTHERS. Wash wash wash your hands. Sanitize you’re house, door handles things commonly used such as remotes, kitchen utensils, door handles, cell phones. Take hot (sauna like) showers. And stay away from anyone that you know that has cancer, recently sick, is elderly or has multiple comorbidities.

Add your personal story about how your family needs help, and send it off! Americans need to see direct relief!!

---

I'm writing to ask that our government give relief to as many people as possible through deferment of mortgage payments.

Many people's largest, non-negotiable expense is housing. Losing the place they call home will cause more disruption than almost any other material loss. People are continuing to do non-essential jobs out in public, risking their health and putting our whole society in danger because they cannot lose the place where they live. By deferring mortgages, homeowners will find immediate relief, landlords can pass the deferment on to their tenants' rent, and small businesses can safely pause while we ride this out.

Much of the proposed COVID-19 relief efforts are only helpful to Americans in salaried, traditional employment situations. [PERSONAL STORY ABOUT MY EMPLOYMENT HERE]

I see contractors, performers, gig workers, freelancers, employees who rely on tips, and small businesses all trying to keep their heads above water before they financially drown. Deferred mortgage payments would be the exact relief necessary to help all of us get through this hard time together.

Though today I had to leave the house to go grocery shopping. I raided the medicine cabinet and saw that we had surgical masks likely from ‘09. I of course popped that bad boy on considering I was coughing constantly.

I went and drove to the grocery store and I could feel the people staring, at one point some teenager even yelled, “It won’t do anything for you man!” And through a raspy voice I’d tell them, “This is so you don’t get sick.” They wouldn’t listen though, it’s funny to make fun of people who take care to not harm themselves or others I guess.

Honestly I don’t truly know what I’m trying to get across with this post. I just feel as if so many Americans have such a conceited mindset and so blindly follow what people tell them, the CDC for example. They also don’t seem to understand basic hygiene or etiquette? Ever since COVID-19 has popped up I’ve realized more and more how little people wash their hands after using the restroom, how little people even try to cover a cough, and generally just how gross many Americans are. 

TLDR: Even if you’re sick and wear a mask people will still look at you funny and even make fun of you. Also people don’t know how to wash their hands.",92,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fhiyo5/i_was_made_fun_of_for_wearing_a_mask_to_protect/

This is great advice but I think something often overlooked are our cellphones. Please wipe them down! If nothing else, with an alcohol pad. Don't forget to let alcohol set for 1 to 2 mins before wiping it off. There are also special wipes for decontamination of electronics.

fcl9m9,CoronavirusUS,Please talk to you school superintendent immediately if you agree with me,3/3/2020 7:34,"In my opinion, the ONLY solution to the COVID19 problem is to shut down schools nationwide immediately, and that is just the 1st step of the solution. The longer the country waits, the worse the damage will be.

If you have a deadly disease that is spreading asymptotically (spreading before people show symptoms), then you cannot wait until after people are showing symptoms to shut down the schools. That is completely illogical. AND IT IS TOO LATE.

You need to stop it before it spreads and the only way to do that starts with shutting down the schools, and then businesses will NEED to operate at minimal capacity (and this is hard to do without specific guidance from the president).

Otherwise, it will just get much worse, and it will be too late.

If you agree with me, take action, please. Start by talking to your schools. If your superintendent doesn't want to shut down the schools, ask him or her, ""When will you shut down the schools then?"" If the superintendent responds, ""After we find that there is community infection"", then you should respond, ""but at that point it would be too late because the disease is spreading asymptotically, has an incubation period of 14 days or more, kids often don't show symptoms anyway, and parents who get sick from their kids also don't know that they have it because they're not getting tested, or are confused and think that they have the regular flu. Therefore, schools need to be shut down immediately.""

Please take action now if you agree with me. And understand that the true number of cases cannot be reported if they are not testing. AND THEY ARE NOT TESTING (nearly enough).

In my opinion, we could easily have over 10,000 infections in our country already. The lack of testing means nobody knows what the true numbers are.

Yes, YOU CAN EASILY MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. All it takes is a rational conversation with your superintendent. They do want to help. They probably just haven’t done their due diligence on coronavirus yet. But with your help, they can get there.

The outstanding news is that if you can convince your superintendent, the community will be saved, and your superintendent will likely convince other superintendents and it will spread. 

Please help make a positive difference to save this world. Thank you.

Edit - this post is starting to get a little attention, and it can easily get much more attention - all you have to do is share it on your Facebook page (or whichever platform you choose) if you agree that it is beneficial to our world to spread this information. Thank you.

At my place of employment, the CEO and the CFO sent out communications noting that there would be a temporary one month 'work-from-home' policy from 12 March thru 12 April. Then our supervisor told us... ""Sorry, that doesn't apply to you guys."" 

Now, I understand that in times of crisis, there are some very important (and likely not very high paying) jobs that can't be 'placed on hold', or worked remotely. There is a very important need for first responders, nurses, police, doctors, air traffic controllers, etc. These jobs are performed by courageous people who often deserve a great deal more for their critical, urgent functions, than they receive.

But, we aren't talking about people performing such functions. 

We are talking about simple customer service work, maybe some analytics work, that can effectively be performed from home.

In my place of employment, my director cares more about performance numbers than about his team. We are often told about the importance of being 'customer-centric'. However, there's never a peep about the importance of being 'employee-centric'. At this point, we'd be happy with employers being 'survival-centric'.

If someone is coughing we tell them to stay home. 
If someone doesn’t feel well in general, we are telling them to stay home. 
The restaurants capacity may exceed 250 ppl. I am choosing not to seat sections in order to keep the gathering to a level below what the WHO suggests. 

So before you ask “To talk to a manager” because it’s taking too long to be sat, or your food is taking longer than normal, or your server seems to be taking on too much and not giving you the level of service you “deserve”. Remember, I’ve made those decisions and judgement calls to keep everyone safe and healthy. You are choosing to come out. I am not, I have to. It’s my job.

Home projects!! Clean out your closet, fix up that room you’ve always wanted to change. think of some projects and then go soon to get supplies before outbreaks get worse. 

2. Organizing your book shelves, cabinets, medicine drawers, spice racks lmao

3. Deep cleaning. (For me cleaning is really therapeutic and helps me deal with stress which we’re all feeling a lot of rn) 

4. Self care!! Disconnect from the news and constant panic and buzz. Long baths, homemade face masks, whatever you consider self care. 

5. If you like to do makeup/hair experiment with new looks. A lot of time can be wasted that way lol. 

6. Baking/ trying new recipes. Nows  the time to perfect your cupcake wars skills. Also baking uses ingredients that aren’t always used for typical cooking so you won’t be wasting resources.

7. Home workouts/yoga! Plenty of videos on Netflix and YouTube (also releases endorphins to relieve stress) Going on long walks outside too, you don’t have to interact with people and it’s relaxing. 

8. Art!!! It doesn’t matter if your good or bad. Release your creativity and let yourself be lost in time in a creative project. Another great distraction technique for stress/anxiety as well.

(My family talked about using Bob Ross to do at home sip n paint sessions 😂 just need a bottles of wine and some cheap easles/paints)

9. hobbies in general. Video games, building things, reading, learning, etc. 

10. Isolation and quarantine can feel really lonely, stressful, depressing. Use technology to your advantage. FaceTime/call your friends and loved ones & catch up. Group video chat with your friends. Create activities you can do together virtually. We’re all in this together.


The main way we can avoid the spread of a virus is to avoid being around a lot of people. Because this is a virus that can be mild or asymptomatic, we can all do our part by social distancing as best we can, regardless of being healthy/ not sick, and hinder the spread of this virus further. it’s going to be a shitty couple of weeks ahead but there our ways to get through this without being miserable.


I want to add! If you have older family members or at risk family and you know you are healthy, try your best to include them. At risk people will feel the most isolated during this time as they know they are restricted by their health. Don’t forget about them. Encourage them to do some of these tips at home or if they live close by, try and join them.",84,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fic5ha/in_the_next_couple_of_weeks_were_all_gonna_be/

fauqp4,CoronavirusUS,(US) Familiarize yourself with FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) for job protection & health insurance,2/28/2020 21:31,"FMLA is a federal benefit, meaning that it covers all states.  It doesn't allow you to take paid leave, but if you need to take an extended period of time off due to illness or caring for someone who is ill, FMLA will keep your health insurance going and keep your job open for you upon your return.

Government website for full details: [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla)

Handy walkthrough with links to the forms (if you don't have a printer, maybe get them printed ahead of time) [https://www.wikihow.com/Fill-out-an-FMLA-Form](https://www.wikihow.com/Fill-out-an-FMLA-Form)    


I also suggest reading up on your state's unemployment benefits.  Different states have different benefits/circumstances covered for claiming benefits.  You don't always have to lose your job to be able to claim benefits--for example, I had a job where the employer had a work stoppage and told everyone not to come to work for a month.  In my state at the time, I could file for that month, even though I was still 'employed'   


**Benefits like these are time sensitive, so it's extremely important to know about them BEFORE you need them.**  For example, have the FMLA forms to bring to the doctor if you/spouse/kids/parents go so that it can be filed before sick days run out.  Even if you just end up using a couple of FMLA days, that's a couple of days that you can't be fired, can't lose your health insurance.

Thank you. Thank you for walking fearlessly into our rooms, taking care of us. You deserve better than what our world is giving you right now.

There are too many people that don’t understand the severity of a novel virus, and how the intense spike of infected persons can crash the medical system, leaving those who just had a stroke, just got in a car crash, or just got diagnosed with cancer, without the manpower and hands to help them. 

Too many people are hoarding masks and supplies that you need to safely walk into the infected patient’s room time and time again, those people hoarding supplies could easily just stay home. 

There are too many hospital CEOs and managements not providing the correct plan, tools, briefings, and protective gear to fight this. Simply saying “we care about our patients” won’t fight an infection. You need a plan, and training to stick to it.

But

You still show up, you still take care of us. 

So, thank you, you deserve it.

Since we have slowly prepared over the last number of weeks, we have avoided the biggest issue out there right now  - crowd gatherings, unnecessary exposure in catching it, for now, and maybe a feeling of relief that we will no longer be chastised for paying attention to this viral threat way before it came to what it is now. 

We can help others. We have the knowledge to share, if asked, and we should do our part to help, if we can. 

For example, even if you have one extra hand sanitizer, give it away to someone less fortunate and in need. It is so hard to come by right now.  (I recently provided one to a homeless person panhandling on the corner of the freeway exit as I was coming home from getting gas - with gloves on, of course).  A small gesture, but it helped me cope with my anxiousness right now.

The local funeral bureau gave out outlines on how to handle cases. It would be similar to other contagious respiratory illnesses. However, our local suppliers have run out of PPE's, hand sanitizer, etc. We only have so much supplies to perform our duties right now.

This is a field where would be impossible for us to work from home. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas, and what other people that work in the field have done to prepare.


*edit: Thank you everyone for your replies and advice. I will check with local officials except I am not expecting much from them. 

Current guidelines from the funeral bureau, based upon information from the CDC, say that we can still operate as normal. However, we should not aspirate the body post embalming to prevent airborne particles. Which puts everyone at the Mortuary and the public at risk. This does not sit well with anyone here. Some fully expect to be quarantined here to continue doing our job.

We will just do our best to do our job for as long as possible. If anyone has any questions then I will answer them as best as possible.

fjvyt0,CoronavirusUS,An open letter to nursing homes,3/17/2020 8:46,"It is Monday, March 16, 2020. I’m sitting in my office at the nursing home at which I work. I have washed my hands, put on a mask and done everything I can to reduce the spread of infection of any kind. All of my co-workers have done the same. We have restricted all visitors, health screened every resident and staff member, cleaned and sanitized the building and all the surfaces in it. We are a community united in the fight against the spread of a virus which is known to be a killer of the elderly and the immunocompromised. And yet, this is not enough.

If there is one thing we have learned from China, Italy, France and Washington state, it’s that whatever they did was not enough. Every day we do the same things others have done, we increase the spread exponentially. We are still sending our staff home at the end of their shift. Home to families who may be doing all of the things necessary to stop transmission, but maybe they aren’t. It only takes one person going home to a family who went to church yesterday to pray for an end to this awful situation, to bring this virus to a place where it could kill dozens of people. By not issuing a full quarantine of our nursing homes, we are inviting death into them. We are turning a blind eye to our most deeply held values as a community in exchange for our own personal comforts of sleeping in our own beds and being with the people we love. 

This is the time to be better.

Call for volunteers to stay at your facilities and care for your residents. If there are staff who have no child care options, for God’s sake, send them home to be with their kids. If there are staff who can be there and are willing to make the sacrifice, let them. When this all blows over, send them home for a month and provide a therapist for them. This would be an unprecedented move, but if it saves the lives of the people who have entrusted their lives to you, then for the love of all that is humane and just and compassionate in the world, make that move! These are people who fought in wars, raised you or your parents and are now feeling just as helpless and afraid as you are, but THEY don’t have a choice as to where they are when this is happening. 

I know there is a lot of gray area in all of this, but there is a black and white choice to be made here. We can either work as individuals to protect ourselves, or we can work as a community to protect each other. History will be a witness to the choices we make, not as individuals, but as communities and governments. We can make a difference if we work together, but we won’t make enough of a difference if we choose to do the minimum of what we can do.",80,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fjvyt0/an_open_letter_to_nursing_homes/

My mom works for a major US airline as a flight attendant. Although she has been trying to minimize her flying time to avoid her risk (she's in her 60s), she is required to work a set number of hours per month. Just last week though she worked an international flight on which there were 3 sick passengers two of which were vomiting and one who was really pale with a headache having connected from London. This was an international flight so when they arrived at the country, they were greeted at the gate by people in protective suits and masks to take everyone's temperature and screening passengers. 

Here is my concern: US airports are doing nothing at all to screen or prevent sick passengers from flying. Company policy as it stands right now also disallows my mom from wearing a protective mask, they can only wear the plastic gloves used to pick up trash. The company is doing nothing to protect its employees from the virus at all and if this continues it's only a matter of time before they're exposed. This isn't a job where you can just work from home or choose not to come in one day. Passengers are constantly passing through from all over the world so the risk of exposure is very high. If the personnel checking passengers have masks should't that mean my mom should at least be allowed to wear one.

Sorry for ranting but I just don't know what to do and was hoping to spread awareness to pressure them to do something. I'm afraid if I don't, things won't change until many people get sick and it's too late. Clearly company policy is dictated by those in an office and not on the actual plane.

Also please understand that I have left some details to be vague as to protect her identity.",79,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fg49zc/mother_is_a_flight_attendant/

We currently live about 10 mins away from the airport in Atlanta so there’s a LOT of Delta employees that live in my area.  I took my daughter tonight to an urgent care to get her some relief from her flu symptoms.

The urgent care was pretty packed with lots of folks with flu symptoms. The doctors and nurses were all wearing masks, which is good. My daughter gets triaged and returned to the waiting room, no big deal.

We get called back and the doctor finally comes in and takes a look at my daughter. They listen to her heart and talk about symptoms, but not a single test was run. Not a blood, urine, nasal or throat swab was taken.

Now, I’m aware of how the corona virus can mimic the flu, but these folks just said she has the flu.  They wrote a couple of prescriptions and sent us on our way. No tests done, just a see ya bye.

I’m not paranoid enough to suspect that my daughter has corona virus, but the utter lack of diagnostics done was shocking. The folks there had no idea if maybe I had a job at the airport or not. They didn’t ask anything besides travel history.

It would have been quite possible for me being 10 mins from the worlds busiest airport to have come in contact with a prospective case. But they didn’t even consider that I could’ve brought this home from work.

I guess what really got me was the lackadaisical attitude towards a flu-like symptom from someone that for all they knew could’ve been a 2nd generation case from China, Italy or S Korea.",72,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fcp8ne/this_really_happened_to_me_today/

Communal salt and pepper shakers have been left out to be shared by every guest that comes in.  No additional cleaning to public bathrooms through the day.  Our busboys and girls are told they can’t wear gloves when handling people’s empty drink glasses and plates.  Weather the company/my boss thinks this will go away we were told to take these precautions and they are being ignored.    

The company jumped out ahead of this with saying they are now giving paid time off to employees.. they gave me 30 dollars.... that legit is just them trying not to have the brand smeared when eventually one of the employees comes infected and gives it to the hundreds of patrons that still have come out to eat (a lot of which into area are older during the day time).

fhs70h,CoronavirusUS,To The Young and Old Who Took Coronavirus Very Seriously: Some Tips On What We Do Now...,3/13/2020 10:07,"I know what if feels like to be scoffed at and/or blown off while mentioning this virus to others weeks ago as I subtly tried to bring it to the forefront in people’s minds. A lot has happened in just 5 weeks.  And as we suspected, it would arrive and now - here it is. 

For those of us that have paid attention to this virus outside of our Country since it first started to unfold in China, what’s happening now is of no surprise to us. Now,  we must move forward and do our best to help keep ourselves and others safe. We are many steps ahead of them, after all. So, I have put together some points that I thought may help:

1-Keep in mind that there are those who will continue to minimize this and call it the flu-we can’t change that, but BE ON YOUR GUARD that if they minimize this, they will also not listen to someone telling them to self-isolate. 

2-Lead by example. Loved ones, friends, co-workers and acquaintances now will be more receptive - maybe not by words, but they will definitely take notice of the extra precautions you are taking. (Hand sanitizer, wiping surfaces at work:cell phones Clorox wipes at gas pumps, etc). 

3-For those that do ask, best advice to offer is do not touch your face and wash hands constantly. This virus only wants your lungs and the way to get it is through your eyes, nose and mouth. 

* switch to glasses over contacts. Ladies-keep in mind when re-applying lipstick, make-up.  Everyone-Use straws over drinking out of cans. Remember those water bottle tops too. 

4-Keep Immunity strong. Drink Energent-C each morning for vitamin C. I found that if you mix it in about 3 inches of water, the orange tastes like orange juice.  (I’ve gotten quite a few to do that now on a regular basis)

5-Forget coins and  $”s exist. This lives on surfaces for who knows how long. Credit and debit cards only. Remember to wipe the keypads before use and after scanning. And, before you add to your wallet and purse. 

I’ve ran out of time for now as I have a very ill dog that needs my tending. He has been my loving companion.  So, if anyone would like me to add to this later, I’d be happy to do so as my father lived through the 1918 Spanish flu and he raised us to always keep something like this in mind because if it happened like that once, it can happen again.

f7j8sb,CoronavirusUS,Personal Experience in Urgent Care Today,2/22/2020 6:50,"Want to share urgent care experience in the Atlanta, Georgia suburbs today.

Have been dealing with dry cough, tight chest / hard to breathe, feeling like crud, headaches & low grade fever. I myself believe its bronchitis. (I am heavily immune supressed for arthitis.) I got better for 3 days, but it came back. This started 3 weeks ago and I already did a 10 day round of amoxicillin.  


I started having really intense coughing fits this morning. So I went to urgent care nearby. I had been there before once last year.

I was relieved to see no patient cars in the parking lot. I went in and signed in. I had tissue in hand and turned away to cough. Receptionist (no mask) asked my symptoms, then pointed me to the face masks, which I happily donned. Used hand santizer and wiped down the pen I used. (I hate possibly transferring this bug to others.) Waited for 10 mins while they processed my health insurance. Sign at desk asked anyone with a cough or fever to wear a mask.

Nurse came to get me. She was wearing a mask.

Temperature was just over 99°F. Doc came in, wearing a mask, discussed symtpoms with me, listened to my chest. No wheezing or congestion heard. She stepped back in alarm when I lifted my mask to blow my nose... i should've warned her first, I guess.

They had me get 3 xrays. I never had gotten an xray for bronchitis before.

Every person interacting with me wore a mask.  


Walked down a hall to xray, someone at a desk had their door open (no mask). When we passed by the 2nd time, door was shut. Remember, I'm having the occasional coughing fits, so everyone could hear me.

I asked about any large increase in patients for assorted bugs going around (yes bad season), then asked kind of like I dont know much about it ""Any of that conoravirus stuff I read the WHO was working on? "" Her reply was luckily no.

Nothing detected initially in the xrays. Got prescriptions for inhaler, codeine and benzonate. And left.

So, a few hours later, thanks to the meds, I'm not coughing as much and no long coughing fits.

But more importantly, the staff at this facility seem to be on alert for people coming in contagious with whatever. I was happy they all wore masks and made me wear one!

Now to kick this bronchitis to the curb, so I can get back to being my old self.",71,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/f7j8sb/personal_experience_in_urgent_care_today/

TLDR: After work today at 6am, I went to get TP that I needed (not to hoard), I decided to be a reasonable and nice person, and gave half of what I had to an elderly couple who were very scared. The old man asked for more than the half I gave him, his wife yelled at him to leave me alone, and they continued to wander around the store in fear. Please be nice to the elderly as they simply do not understand how unreasonable others are being, and thus are being unreasonable themselves.

[6AM, After Working 3rd Shift At A Factory For Me]

Let me start by saying I have utmost respect for people working in the markets these last few days across america. You're enduring so much panic and crazy as people forget how to be civil, freak out, are rude buttheads, and demanding supplies that are not there. I use to work retail and customer service so I know what this crap is like, and I tip my hat to you during these days. And because of my years of experience in that, I am able to be cool and level headed.

I snagged myself (because we did need it at my home as we were down to our last 4 rolls) 4 packages that were 6 rolls/package for $5 of toilet paper. So I found some in the store, and start to wander around, looking for other things when I realized, ""ya know, I do not need all 4 packages. I'll put 2 back."" Practicing modesty and understanding that others would need some too.

I wander back to put 2 back and there is an old lady in her scooter and her husband. They are scared. They have 3 cases of water in the cart this old man is pushing. I see them staring at the toliet paper and frowning. So! Me being a good person, decided to give them the 2 I was about to put back. 

The old lady thanks me, expressing that I saved them another trip and racing around. She tells me their backs cannot take much running around, that their legs and hands hurt, and how thankful she was that I decided to give them half of what I had. I hand the 2 packages to the old man, and he has the audacity to demand, ""I want one more."" Man. I was about to rip his head off but that old lady piped right up, ""you leave her alone! We have enough! Shut up!"" He switch tones right away with me and instead thanked me.

At checkout, I could see this old man at another checkout lane. He kept watching me. I'm unsure what for or about. Maybe he wanted to apologize or was so scared that he wanted to see if I'd take pity on him, and give him another package. I do not know, and honestly I was not exactly overly offended. I'm all about helping elderly and others. But the moment they demand more than half of what you gave them like he did? It puts stones in my heart because now I have to tell them off.

I understand what stoked their fear. I understand this is a big deal. I understand that if an older person gets this, recovery rate is hard on them. But for the life of me, I do not like it when people cannot be reasonable or civil. Then I realized my anger over him asking for more is just as unreasonable. I'm glad his wife beat me to saying something because it did give me a reality check.

Yesterday they announced that we were moving to online classes AFTER spring break (spring break: March 15th-22nd). Despite our campus being closest to the confirmed coronavirus cases (compared to JHU, umbc, Towson, etc) in Maryland & having a LARGE commuter base, UMD has decided to force us to go to school for the rest of the week. Why? Because of midterms. Midterms > lives (not a Columbia, but at UMD? Sure...)

They sent out emails about social distancing, but it’s hard to social distance yourself in a lecture of 100+ students.

Their logic? No confirmed cases at UMD = no problems. The issue is, UMD refuses to actually test anyone. Multiple people have reported of high fever as well as exposure from the CPAC conference & the university has remained silent/failed to notify anyone or allowed anyone to be tested. They simply hang up the phone and tell students to “exercise caution”. Some teachers, refuse to work with sick students on making up assignments.

As a student I’m disappointed. I live around immunocompromised & elderly people, I don’t want to risk exposing anyone.  We had a girl die of adenovirus + mold negligence last year and the university seems to not have learned their lesson.

All of this to say, don’t necessarily trust 100% what the government says. The situation could be  worse, but they won’t do anything to stop it as soon as possible. Very reactionary. 

UMD students will continue to infect each other this week & then travel around the country to our respective homes & vacation plans where more people across the US will be infected.

He deteriorated significantly on Monday with a decent fever (101.5), intense headache/body aches and exhaustion. He went to urgent care on Tuesday evening where he tested negative for flu and they refused to test him for covid (not having had a travel history or respiratory symptoms). They didn’t offer him a strep test because he didn’t have a sore throat and there wasn’t any inflammation. He has been sleeping 22 hours per day since then with no improvement in symptoms. For background, he is 41 with no pre-existing conditions. However, he was hospitalized with an adenovirus-induced pneumonia 6 years ago, which wasn’t normal for his age group. At the time he was a sub-3 hour marathon runner and his ER doc at the time (who knew him from the gym) was shocked that he was stricken. Today he woke up for an hour in the morning but then was asleep the rest of the day.

He still doesn’t have breathing or respiratory issues but not everyone with covid does. I feel increasingly concerned with his lack of improvement. I’d like to get him tested but that seems unlikely given the lack of tests. He assumes he has flu and just had a false negative. I’m wondering if others have heard of people suffering this much without specific breathing challenges or if folks are aware of something going around that isn’t the flu.

Wife thinks we should quite, she is already retired.  I agree with her and a lot of you that our government is not helping in this matter.  My issue is economic.  We don't really have the money to retire, I was planning on working for another 15 years at least.  And even if we did stop working, lose my job, and stay at the house for awhile, assume it even gets better in the summer, and survive this first wave, what the hell are we going to do after.

We have enough to survive for awhile, but I haven't figured out how or if I can work from home,  I'm not a techie, we would have to build that business and figure it out pretty fast, and the economy looks like it'll take a massive hit, not sure if we can depend on it.

Not really sure what I'm asking, I guess I'm just ranting.  I would love to stay home, and we still might, we have some food saved.  But I just don't know what the hell we'll do in 6 months, and then maybe it'll come back worse.  Just sitting on another time bomb again.

this doesn't seem terribly likely to me. in a natural disaster like a hurricane, or a tornado or earthquake, yes that is highly likely, but this is just a disease outbreak. it's a different thing that, while yes, it could be catastrophic, it probably will not result in a catastrophic failure of infrastructure, especially not something as important as water, which the folks in charge will likely prioritize.

2. aren't they expensive?

not inherently. sure, there are super high tech fancy japanese toilets that cost a lot, but you can get a very basic attachment that can be easily and quickly installed on any standard american toilet (or anywhere else where they're not common, where it's just a bowl, a tank, and a seat) for like $30. if you want a super basic one, they cost as little as $20-$25",67,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fh3rgh/if_youre_trying_to_buy_toilet_paper_but_cant_due/

People argue ""its just the flu,"" but they fail to see the systemic domino effect it could potentially cause. We already have an overstressed healthcare system in the US as well as an apparent normalcy bias among the average citizen that this isnt a big deal. 20 percent of people affected require hospitalization, the more severe cases (around 10 percent) require ICU stays up to six weeks. Add to the fact that the virus has up to a 30 day incubation period and can be spread when people are asymptomatic, this has a real potential to get out of hand. Consider how many people with preexisting conditions aside from Covid 19 will not have access to medical providers in the event that we dont get this under control. The logic that the flu kills more people isnt the point. If this becomes endemic its going to be the other issues that arise from it that kill people. Lack of resources will result in tough choices having to be made and certain people will be left to die. Feel free to have your own opinion on it, I even hope im wrong. Something tells me this is just the beginning though, and this will be an eye opening experience for everyone. I dont think china locked down 65 million people and risked tanking their economy for just the flu. Italy just quarantined 16 million people. Watch what they do, not what they say.

Level with me and hear me out. I can already see the knee jerk reactions containing AD HOMINEM, categorize them please, so I don't have to.

**Let's get right to it.**

1. People may be washing their hands more. Ya'll need to do it anyways, but since the onset of the pandemic, we are focusing a lot of our attention on hygiene. Covering our mouths and restricting body-to-body contact, and policing our own day-to-day behavior, has brought some much needed introspection when there's usually none.
2. We start to care more about our family members. We ask them how they're doing in life. We ask them if they can afford food, and if they have enough provisions to last 14 days. I would like to believe that we are more compassionate now that there's an inevitable pandemic and we need to take care of our family members and we need to make sure that their basic needs are met.
3. I've seen so many ""people first"" or ""humanity first"" questions and behaviours, instead of focusing on superficial things. I have literally seen, from my time loitering in [r/coronavirus](https://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirus/), how people put aside shallow life problems and actually ask others how they are doing both mentally and physically. An otherwise intrusive Auntie, who always asks you how you're going to pay for college, is more worried about your respiratory symptom and your well being, instead of pestering you about other things that are out of your control.
4. The self-quarantine FORCES PEOPLE TO BE IN CLOSE FAMILY PROXIMITY. Those unresolved relationship issues? Maybe some quality time might actually cause you to have that breakthrough or catharsis that you've been meaning to have in your life.
5. My partner and I don't have to care so much about how we look and we don't have to worry about huge crowds or insane public areas. I don't worry anymore about whether or not there's going to be traffic on my way to my university.
6. Some random person invents a new and truly decentralized internet, free from political and private influence. BECAUSE THEY WERE INSIDE AND HAD ENOUGH TIME FOR Self-Improvement and Self-Reflection

ffcoqo,CoronavirusUS,Something to keep in Mind: Our Shoes,3/8/2020 21:41,"It occurred to me today that the soles and tops of our shoes can be a source of transmission.  Think about where we walk in our daily daily lives - parking lots, stores, elevators, work places, public bathrooms. 

After a long day, we go home and walk those same shoes Into our homes.  Then we take them off. 

I think you see what I am trying to say... the virus lives on surfaces. 

As an extra precaution take your shoes off at the door. 

Wipe shoes down with a disinfectant wipe after you take them off and then immediately wash your hands. 

Don’t walk through the floors and carpet of your house.  

Purses, backpacks and carriers. Be mindful where we set them daily in public places. Bring them home and place in one spot, near the door, wipe down handles and bottoms and wash hands afterwards. 

Just wanted to put this out there as a way to keep everyone safe in case I might be onto something.",64,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/ffcoqo/something_to_keep_in_mind_our_shoes/
fe3dxz,CoronavirusUS,Lengthy but informative message from a pathologist who's studied the coronavirus for years,3/6/2020 6:29,"Dear Colleagues,

As some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources. 

The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:
1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.
This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.
I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it.
Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.
I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share.

Good luck to all of us!

Without getting too political, I think us young and healthy individuals can all agree that:

1. The United States and many other countries are not prepared for this crisis
2. It's highly dangerous for our older population and/or people with underlying medical conditions to be exposed to this disease.
3. Some of the people described in (2) do not have the support system necessary to retrieve their basic essentials without exposing themselves (see links below):

**Okay yes it's a problem, but how is an app going to fix this?**

In recent years we've seen charitable crowdsourced apps gain traction during times of crisis. In last year's Hong Kong protests, an app that tracked ""police hot spots"" gained immense popularity:

[https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3032001/apple-allows-hong-kong-protest-map-app-can-track-police-and](https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3032001/apple-allows-hong-kong-protest-map-app-can-track-police-and)

An app might not fix the Coronavirus/Elderly problem, but I don't see many other solutions in the works. Uber Eats is possible, but not everyone: has Uber Eats access, can afford it, or can rely on Uber drivers indefinitely during a pandemic. I was thinking of an app that essentially copies the format of Tinder, with a few modifications:

* To begin, Profiles of Individuals in Need who we can call ""People In Need"" (PIN) would need to be verified, and this process could begin with letting official entities (nursing homes, caretakers, etc) provide us with known PINs and input them into the network. Many caretakers are likely aware of PINs, but might not have the bandwidth to help them. Using a representative would also solve any potential technical hurdles for the non-tech savvy.
* A map that shows a rough geo-location of PINs, to give an idea of who you might be able to help in your area.
* If you find a candidate, you can match them (like Tinder) and contact them to coordinate necessities.
* No money involved, only tangible donations

I have some other random ideas (eg roles can be dived up into a donater, a shopper, and a runner), but no need to overcomplicate it at this stage.

It's only me right now, so if anyone out there wants to build this together and make a difference (instead of sitting around on the internet doing nothing during quarantine), please comment on here or you can dm me at [twitter.com/fiebsy](https://twitter.com/fiebsy).",57,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fk52ue/any_developers_out_there_who_would_want_to_build/

fk0q0b,CoronavirusUS,CHARTER COMM UPDATE. Someone was forced to resign over not understanding Charter’s no work from home policy during coronavirus outbreak,3/17/2020 14:52,"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/charter-coronavirus-work-home/amp/

Wheeler is going on the record because he said it was unacceptable that Charter is, unlike other companies, not employing a work-from-home strategy in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19.

—

Wheeler is not alone in his concerns. At least two other emails allegedly sent by employees, which were posted **anonymously to Reddit** but TechCrunch is unable to verify their authenticity, criticized Charter for putting its employees “under harm and risk.”

“A hazard condition isn’t acceptable for the infrastructure beyond the short-term. Why is it acceptable for our health?” wrote Wheeler.

*Hours later, he was no longer an employee.*

Just a few minutes after Wheeler sent the email, *he was summoned to a vice president’s office to a conference call with human resources*. In a call with TechCrunch, Wheeler said his email was described as “irresponsible” and “inciting fear.” He said it was hard to understand why Charter had not implemented a work-from-home policy after the coronavirus outbreak was upgraded to a pandemic.

*Wheeler said he was given an ultimatum. Either he could work from the office or take sick leave. Staff are not allowed to work from home, he was told. Wheeler offered his resignation, but was sent home instead and asked to think about his decision until Monday.*

**Later in the day, he received a call from work. Charter accepted his resignation, effective immediately.**

—

The employees said that Charter’s leadership has long disallowed working from home, and that management decides on a case-by-case basis and only when they’ve seen a doctor’s note. The employees said that in absence of a work-from-home policy, employees are expected to burn through their sick leave.

Staff are given a week of sick leave a year, which accrues over time, but current government guidance is to self-quarantine for two weeks after symptoms subside, meaning some staff would have to take a portion of unpaid sick leave.

But Charter has shown little sign of backing down. In an all-staff email sent Saturday and seen by TechCrunch, Charter’s chief executive Tom Rutledge doubled down on the policy.",54,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fk0q0b/charter_comm_update_someone_was_forced_to_resign/

They have a long road ahead.",3/16/2020 1:11,"An estimated 32 million people have come down with the regular flu this flu season, and about 18,000 people have died.  [https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-05/flu-killed-more-people-coronavirus-covid-19](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-05/flu-killed-more-people-coronavirus-covid-19) .The people with serious cases of the flu, in most states, have the hospital beds they need along with the attention of healthy nurses and physicians.

Now, add Coronavirus.

Coronavirus patients who are hit hard with the virus will now be flooding the emergency rooms and hospitals with a completely different illness, one which is highly more contagious than the flu. One that will take up additional hospital beds. One that will take additional hospital staff's care and attention, one that will take ventilators and IVs and medications that were originally intended for flu patients, people with cancer, people recovering from surgery.

It takes time to allocate everything that is needed to successfully fight this and we are very quickly running out of time. We cannot create doctors and nurses overnight. We cannot bring in additional doctors or nurses from other states or countries because everyone in the world is affected by this.

Doctors and nurses seem like superheroes, working incredibly long hours, investing everything they have towards caring for people they don't even know, putting others needs before their own. But they are human. And some will catch Coronavirus and some will die. The healthy ones will still be battling exhaustion and emotional stress like they have never seen.

Even if you don't believe that Coronavirus is serious, please still take precautions to help lessen the load and prevent additional infections. Not only for you but for everyone. And thank a doctor or nurse if you see them.

fjg3ig,CoronavirusUS,Projected USA COVID-19 Cases over the next 2 weeks,3/16/2020 13:56,"The novel coronavirus and its associated disease, COVID-19, are wreaking terrible costs on medical systems, families, and economies around the globe. The pandemic is now spreading across the USA, with particularly severe outbreaks in New York, Washington State, and California, but cases confirmed and increasing in every state (except West Virginia, but that could change quickly). 

**To help get a sense of how the virus might continue to spread, I have created projections of how many confirmed cases of COVID-19 the USA might be reporting over the coming weeks.**  

Based on data provided by Worldometer ([https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)), **confirmed COVID-19 cases in the USA have increased by 24-44% (average, 32%) EVERY DAY between March 2-14, 2020**. For instance, while there were 319 cases on March 6, there were 435 on March 7 (a 36% increase). While there were 2,247 US cases on March 13, there were 2,943 on March 14 (a 31% increase).

https://preview.redd.it/onpf4kncnym41.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=e42818cabf7414303d0fb2240134dde9de82e773

 It is widely anticipated that the number of known cases is a gross underestimate of **true** US infections due to severe under-testing across the country as well as the fact that perhaps \~80% of infected people have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic (SOURCE:  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30567-5/fulltext). 

If the current exponential rate of increase continues (24-44% daily), the US will shortly see skyrocketing cases (as has occurred in China, Italy, Spain, Iran, France, and Germany, among other countries, some of which have managed to control the epidemic, and others not). Assuming the number of US cases will continue increasing at the current rate for at least the next week, **I have projected the minimum, maximum, and average number of cases that would be observed in the US every day from now through March 21st**. 

 Purple=Projection based on maximum observed daily % increase between 3/2-3/14 (44.34%) 

 Blue=Projection based on average observed daily % increase between 3/2-3/14 (32.75%) 

 Red=Projection based on minimum observed daily % increase between 3/2-3/14 (24.0%) 

[Forecasted number of cases over the next week](https://preview.redd.it/4925xn9stym41.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a06228c68204652335c3bdbe89cdf0b833593e4)

Figures were derived using this exponential formula: 

(Cases on given date) = (Cases on March 14) \* ((Daily Increase Rate; i.e., 1.24, 1.37, or 1.44) \^ (Days passed since March 14; e.g., 1 for March 15, 2 for March 16, etc.))

**Case numbers on March 21 are projected to be: 13,266 (low rate); 21,380 (average rate); or 38,422 (high rate).** The accuracy of these numbers will depend on whether the daily case increase rate tracks rates seen over the past two weeks. **This is a forecast model, not a prophecy**. The rate of increase could slow if containment and/or mitigation measures successfully curb the spread of the virus. Alternatively, the rate of increase could speed up if heightened testing reveals dramatic under counting of cases or if outbreaks in current US epicenters (e.g., Seattle, NYC, Bay Area, LA) instigate strong outbreaks in other parts of the country.  

We have one data point in this regard because we now have total US cases reported on March 15: 3,680 cases. This represents \~25% increase since 3/14: closer to the low rate of increase, but within the observed range.  

Cases will of course continue to increase beyond mid-March. The farther out from the present you go, the more uncertain the continued daily rate of increase, but assuming the recent rates hold over the next two weeks, here is a projection of total reported US cases through March 28.

 Purple=Projection based on maximum observed daily % increase between 3/2-3/14 (44.34%) 

 Blue=Projection based on average observed daily % increase between 3/2-3/14 (32.75%) 

 Red=Projection based on minimum observed daily % increase between 3/2-3/14 (24.0%) 

[Forecasted number of cases over the next two weeks](https://preview.redd.it/a23e9252oym41.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=e39e129073a1a390affabcb63833ec69574fe62a)

Note, the number of cases starts at 2,943 on 3/14. The numbers get so much larger than this by March 28 that it looks like this starts at zero, but it doesn't. 

**Case numbers on March 28 projected to be: 59,799 (low rate); 155,314 (average rate); or 501,612 (high rate).** Remember, the accuracy of these numbers will depend on whether the daily case increase rate tracks rates from the past two weeks. 

Of course, cases will likely continue to increase beyond March 28, and one could continue extrapolating, but I ended the projection there due to high uncertainty in whether the rate of increase will remain constant. For my own interest and hopefully yours, I plan to continue updating this forecast model to reflect adjusted daily increase rates as we get new data every day. You can view the updating forecast models in this Google spreadsheet:

In the meantime, practice good anti-virus hygiene, strongly consider social distancing, and call anyone you think might be lonely.

The number of coronavirus cases compounds more than 25% per day in countries that do not mandate social distancing. USA will reach the Italian density by March 30.,3/12/2020 12:40,"[COVID-19 Coronavirus Cases Worldwide by Country per 100,000 Inhabitants from First Day with First Case \(Semi-Log Scale\)](https://preview.redd.it/3aqzvtv466m41.png?width=2704&format=png&auto=webp&s=31240d81aebf9ce62808b7845a074c4e80b363b8)

I used primary data from the World Health Organization to predict the trajectory of the 2019 Coronavirus outbreak on a country-by-country basis. I normalized the number of cases in each country to the population of that country using United Nations publications. This resulted in a normalized number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants for each country for each day.

Using the date of the first confirmed coronavirus case in each country as its day 0, I tracked the growth by day in normalized coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants, from the earliest known start of the epidemic in each country.

&#x200B;

**Summary**

1. The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak is at an inflection point.
2. The data strongly suggests that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities and workplaces (“Social Distancing”).
3. The number of coronavirus cases compounds at more than 25% per day in countries that do not mandate social distancing. This behavior is consistent across Iran, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, each measured independently from the date of the first case in that country, with root-mean-square accuracy R^(2) \> 99%.
4. The highly precise exponential growth strongly suggests that the growth in these cases is due to an underlying biological phenomenon (e.g. virus transmission) rather than due to an increase in the availability of tests or the number of tests performed.
5. At a density of approximately 9.7 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Italy mandated on 3/8/20 a complete regional lock-down, with movement restrictions applying to about 16 million people (25% of the population of Italy). The following day, on 3/9/20, the lock-down was extended to the entire country (100% of the population of Italy).

[Coronavirus cases grow exponentially at more than 25&#37; per day in countries that do not mandate social distancing.](https://preview.redd.it/13dkeezi76m41.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=580c1c042de984205c64b3d42aef317133057ab1)

**Predictions**

6. US — I predict that the US density will reach the Italian threshold of 9.7 US coronavirus cases per 100,000 US inhabitants by March 30, 2020. This threshold density is equal to the density of cases when Italy implemented a regional lock-down that affected 25% of its population.

7. US — I predict that the density could reach 87 US coronavirus cases per 100,000 US inhabitants by April 9, 2020, in some regions, unless further social controls are adopted. I computed 87 cases per 100,000 inhabitants as the threshold density at which all currently unoccupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds would be occupied by a US person who is infected with coronavirus and has severe, life-threatening symptoms. In other words, no regional beds to house patients who are severely ill.

All of these numbers are an underestimate of the actual numbers with the US numbers being one of the most underestimated. However, this underestimate won’t affect the March 30 or April 9 prediction much (moving them sooner by a few days) since the underestimate is a multiplicative factor whereas the growth is exponential.

**Based on this analysis, our conclusion is as follows:**

1. I believe that the US is likely to mandate substantially more invasive quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities and workplaces (“Social Distancing”) in the near term when ICU beds are unavailable and patient deaths begin to rise precipitously.
2. This will affect a significantly larger percentage of the US population than is currently affected by voluntary social distancing, including younger people in the workforce who might be asymptomatic but who are forced to work from home and curtail spending and travel.
3. The number of people affected in the US will increase dramatically within the next three weeks. The overall slowdown in economic activity is likely to be more severe and of longer duration than is currently anticipated.
4. Due to the market's perception of an economic slowdown, companies need to shift from a revenue growth mentality to a capital preservation mentality. Markets will reward profitability and strong balance sheets over growth. Cash will be king.
5. **Message to all startup companies in particular**:

\- Focus on cashflow. Become profitable if you can. Expect to be very flexible on valuation if you need to raise capital. Raising capital may become impossible over the next few quarters for some companies.

\- Anticipate missing quarterly revenue targets due to customers delaying orders and/or cancelling new projects. Rebuild an operating plan that is robust to significant cash shortfall from diminished revenues.

\- Immediately look for ways to reduce your company’s expense structure to extend its cash runway (including delayed hiring plans but also implementing RIFs now).

\- Sacrifice growth for runway. “Must be present to win.”

**Method**:

The data was compared on a semi-log plot to identify exponential growth in cases. This data is shown in the figure below. The horizontal axis is days from the first reported case (T0) for each country. The vertical axis is the the number coronavirus patients per 100,000 inhabitants, on a Log scale. Each country is a different color line.

We use a semi-log plot for two reasons. First, exponential growth appears as a straight line on a semi-log plot. The human eye is very good at identifying straight lines. Second, a semi-log plot allows one to compare similar growth rates over time across widely different base rates (in this case, from 0.02 cases to 200 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Lines with equal slopes on a semi-log plot have equal growth rates irrespective of their absolute magnitude or position in time.

The data strongly suggests that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities and workplaces (“Social Distancing”). The most striking differences (between China, Hong Kong, and Japan versus the rest of the world) confirm the hypothesis of person-to-person transmission as the driver of exponential growth since the countermeasures they have taken specifically limit this and do nothing to change the detection rate.

I fit the growth in coronavirus cases to exponential curves in five countries. I found that the number of coronavirus cases compounds at approximately 25% per day in countries that do not mandate social distancing. This behavior is consistent across Iran, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, each measured independently from the date of the first case in that country, with root-mean-square accuracy R^(2) \> 99%.",50,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fhawki/i_used_primary_data_from_who_to_predict_the/

fcphwh,CoronavirusUS,Copied message from a doctor with tips on getting through Corona virus,3/3/2020 12:54,"This is good.. read it.. may keep you from getting Coronavirus
Sent: Saturday, February 29, 2020, 12:46:40 PM CST
Subject: Coronavirus
 
 
 
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
As some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.
 
The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.
 
Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:
 
1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
 
2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
 
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
 
4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
 
5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
 
6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
 
7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!
 
What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
 
1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas. Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land on are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
 
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
 
3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
 
4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.
 
I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.
 
I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. Good luck to all of us! Jim

""Hope your Spring Break is somewhat relaxing. It seems like we only hear bad news nowadays, so everyone is probably on edge. I recently heard a short interview with Dr. Drew this week, which made me feel better about all this, and I think it helped me look at the current situation in a less fearful and more pragmatic way. He said:

“I just want to re-assure everyone that you are going to be fine. The panic from this virus is quite a bit worse than the actual virus itself. All you have to do, if you are in a risk category, if you’re elderly, or if you have chronic medical problems, avoid crowds, don’t travel unnecessarily, wash your hands all the time. You all should be doing that. Get your flu shots… And follow the directions of Anthony Fauci at the CDC. He is the guy whose job it is to contain this thing. The local measures that they are taking seem excessive to me. He has not recommended these things. And bringing our lives to a standstill is NOT what he is recommending at all. What he is recommending is we go about our business. He has said repeatedly, that although this is a more serious illness and it is more contagious, the average American will be fine. He has said that repeatedly…. We’ll be through this soon.”

fim4pg,CoronavirusUS,MY COUSIN HAS CORONA VIRUS BUT THE HOSPITAL WONT ALLOW HIM TREATMENT,3/15/2020 1:37,"Two days ago my COUSIN was at school, and went down to the nurses office because they was having extreme chest pains, shortness of breath, and was starting to get a fever. The nurse told them that they was alright , but the nurse said that he could call his mom to let him stay home. My cousin calls his mom, and could barley speak since he was having trouble breathing, but told my aunt that he wanted to go to the ER. My aunt, realizing that she couldn't get there in time from her work, called an ambulance to pick him up from HER HOUSE NOT THE SCHOOL. So my cousin ends up going him, and in the ambulance with my grandparents (who live with them).

During the ambulance ride, when the paramedics were trying to ask him questions, he had to write them down on paper because he couldn't talk and breath at the same time. Once they got to the hospital, they waited in the waiting room for 30 minutes with all the other patients, and got a room. He got all sorts of tests to make sure it wasn't a problem with his heart or anything. His fever got so high to the point that it was 104 degrees, and was resigning oxygen to help him breath.

Finally, the nurses came back, and told my Aunt that my cousin has a viral/bacterial lung infection in the lungs, but they don't know what caused it or the details. They gave him a inhaler, and let him go.

My aunt asked about corona virus testing, and told her that he had the symptoms for the corona virus but that they would not test him or provide treatment since he was young (he is 16 with no preexisting medical conditions as far as I know).

What I'm worried about is that both my grandparents live with my cousin, and both are in their 80s with medical conditions. My cousin is currently staying at home, and has self quareiteened in his room, but the problem is he has already touched every surface in the house, and my cousins family has not even cleaned anything. My cousins own the house next door to them, that my grandparents could stay at with my other aunt, but they refuse saying that its not a big deal since the hospital won't do anything.

His breathing got worse, along with his fever throughout the night. With the hospital saying he has all the symptoms, but won't test him or treat him because he is young is absurd to me. AND the fact that my grandparents are at risk is crazy.

I don't know what to do know. I am worried for my cousin, but also the people at his high school, my grandparents, the hospital staff, the patients who were all in the same room as him in the waiting room.

Me and family can't do anything about this, or knock any sense into his family to take him to hospital again, and beg for testing because we live in Canada, while they are from Illinois ( near the Chicago suburbs)

I know that privacy is an issue since I just shared the location, but at this point its not safe for the people who have come in contact with him.

I am asking for advice on what to do, or what my parents can say to my Aunt to get him in the hospital, or any advice on forcing the hospital to do testing for the Corona Virus.",49,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fim4pg/my_cousin_has_corona_virus_but_the_hospital_wont/

Bothell High School was closed Thursday over fear of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19.

In a letter sent to parents Wednesday, Northshore School District Superintendent Michelle Reid said a school staff member returned to work on Monday after a week of international travel. A family member traveling with them then became sick Tuesday and was taken to an unidentified hospital. Reid said testing for the disease could take five to seven days.

Read the school district statement

“The Department of Health indicates the risk to students and staff is minimal and they do not believe the current situation warrants closing Bothell High School,” the letter said. “However, as we await the aforementioned test results, it is out of an abundance of caution that I have decided that Bothell High School will be closed on Thursday.”

fj0qfv,CoronavirusUS,Grocery stores are the largest point of infection,3/15/2020 20:39,"Grocery stores and pharmacies will not shut down due to coronavirus. All the sanitizing and cleaning will not save you from an airborne virus in an enclosed space


An infected person is contagious for days before showing symptoms. This disease has been spreading undetected for weeks. Community transmission is certainly happening in every major city at this point


Grocery store employees are exposed to other people's germs for 8 hours straight and are not allowed to wear masks. It is inevitable that many will be asymptomatic spreaders. Even if they limit the number of people entering the stores, the employees are likely already carriers of the virus.


These are exactly the kind of people who will not call out for fear of losing their job. Most businesses like these are only offering sick leave for employees if they test positive for covid-19, and precious few will qualify for testing


This should matter beyond how you personally may get infected. We have a large number of people who will not be offered self quarantine like the rest of the country, but face eventual homelessness and starvation should they stop showing up. They are being forced to expose themselves to infection WITHOUT any personal protective equipment like medical staff, and will continue to spread it to the members of our community that still think this isn't a big deal and want to keep shopping, or are hoarding in a blind panic.

So something keeps niggling at my brain with persistence and I want you all to help flesh it out.

Based on the early Lancet report of 41 patients. The virus was thought to be spreading in early November I believe.

CCP shuts down the 8 doctors in early December.

CCP notifies WHO on December 31st.

Question: What if the virus has been circulating since late November in the US?

Did I lose you already? Hear me out.  

We have this incredibly highly transmissible virus that appears to have exponential growth.

We had/have a really bad flu season, but the flu shot was a very good match this year.

We know you can get both the flu and the coronavirus because one of the first deaths out of China was a fellow who had the flu, coronavirus and strep. 

Almost immediately the CDC moved to the mitigation stage because containment was impossible due to likely had already jumped territory boundaries in December or January before Wuhan lockdown.

But wait, you say....how could that be possible because only a few countries are getting hammered so far? 

I am a firm believer that the pollution in the Hubei province exacerbated their cases. Since this virus causes pneumonia, breathing polluted air with pneumonia is hell. Breathing anything other than pure oxygen is an exercise of stamina.

Pollution moves with the wind and I think this is why SK and Japan are getting hammered, not to mention that Japan has the oldest population demographic. Not sure where SK stands.

So now we move to Italy, they also have an incredibly high elderly population.

Iran, while some of the population do well, it's really the land of have-nots due to crippling US sanctions.

The U.S. has one of the best medical systems in regards to highly trained doctors and technology(at the cost of every American's pocket), but damn it's expensive here. We also have nothing like the pollution in Hubei. People also visit their doctors offices or urgent clinics and not just hospitals, like what China does.

We have been diverting emergency room visits to other hospitals all winter.

Let's face it, our country would keep us in the dark to prevent panic(oh look, they are doing it now!)

Did Trump put a travel ban on Hubei because he knew it was already outside of China, but it's part of the CDCs recommendation to lengthen the spread time to reduce the chance of a spike.

Are they telling people not to buy masks because it's already been working it's way through our country since late November/early December(Thanksgiving is our most travelled holiday).

Is this why the CDC is not pushing testing because the cat is out of the bag at that point?

How many people do you know that had a terrible time this winter kicking their cold?



Ok, so I am done. Be gentle. I've only had about 2 hours of sleep and have only had ONE cup of coffee so far. I look forward to your comments, but please don't be an ass. If you knew the day I had yesterday, I am a mess emotionally and I really really need this distraction.

Thank you all and happy reading.

Travelers worried about booking a flight due to coronavirus concerns can find “peace of mind” when booking on JetBlue, which will temporarily suspend change and cancellation fees for new reservations, [the airline announced Wednesday](http://blueir.investproductions.com/investor-relations/press-releases/2020/02-26-2020-223815864).

When travelers book a flight between February 27 and March 11 for travel completed by June 1, they will not be charged fees for changes or cancellations later “given evolving coronavirus concerns,” according to the airline, which is [Logan International Airport’s](https://www.boston.com/tag/logan-airport) largest carrier.

“While authorities have not issued any travel restrictions to the locations we fly, we want to give our customers some peace of mind that we are ready to support them should the situation change,” Joanna Geraghty, president and chief operating officer for JetBlue, said in a statement. “Given our mission is to inspire humanity, we felt this suspension was an important way to live up to our crew member and customer expectations during this uncertain time. We are committed to the health and safety of both our crew members and customers, and we are working directly with health and security officials as well as industry leaders for updates and best practices.”",42,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/faiwai/jetblue_will_temporarily_allow_flight_changes_due/

fj5ikq,CoronavirusUS,US Customs’ lack of concern,3/16/2020 2:04,"TD;DR - I literally walked right through US customs at the airport without being asked any questions. Prevention at the source is best.

I recently traveled to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Japan. I was amazed and impressed by those countries carefulness and tactics to control the spread of this virus. They have VERY through screenings, such as thermo/ temp checking stations, interviews, and requesting additional information in case they need to contact you at their airport customs. And many places I went in those countries, businesses had their own temperature check points, and they insisted me to use hand sanitizer before entering. And their citizens take extra safety precaution measures, especially in Taiwan where they have less than 50 cases in the WHOLE country.

These four countries have less cases combined than the US. And they are right next to China and have a lot more visitors from there. 

Yesterday I landed in SFO. Since I have Global Entry, I just went to the machines and answered a few questions there to get my entry receipt. As I was walking to the custom agent station with my receipt, I was expecting being asked where I have travelled to, any illness symptoms, or having my forehead temperature checked. NOPE, none of those. All the agent did was pointing at the pile of receipts and told me to put mine there. I was shocked. And I walked right out into the airport. I had not felt this unsafe during a time of a disease spread before. And I feel there is a higher chance of me contracting COVID19 here than in Asia.",43,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fj5ikq/us_customs_lack_of_concern/

If that family gets quarantined, no one is going out to buy toilet paper for 2-4 weeks. Sick people also tend to use the bathroom more. Even if you’re not quarantined, kids aren’t in school and people are working for home. That’s an extra 4-5 trips to the home bathroom through the day. You’re going to need extra tp. On top of that, people see other stocking up and decide to stock up themselves and it creates a cycle.

Excerpt:  
**What to do if you are at higher risk:**

* Stay at home as much as possible.
* Make sure you have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
* When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often.
* Avoid crowds.
* Stay up to date on [CDC Travel Health Notices](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).

fkqhs1,CoronavirusUS,Hospital trip unrelated to covid current experience,3/18/2020 22:37,"My elderly mom has cancer and diabetes. She’s having some complications that didn’t allow us to wait for the doctor to open. To get my mind off it, I thought I would tell people what to expect if they need to go to the ER for something not related to the virus. My mom is highly immunocompromised, I am not. 

My husband had acquired one N95 mask a few days ago. I put it on her, a pair of gloves (I don’t know, I’m trying?), gloves on myself, and a bandana over my face (who cares who looks crazy at this point?) and we head to the ER. The gloves we put on during the drive. 

There is a small “building” in front, plastic sealed tent like, outside of the ER entrance, and one nurse in full protective gear stationed beside it (her get up kinda reminds me of what they wore in ET, but not quite as dramatic.) I drop my mom off and go park. There are police cars parked at the main entrance, not normally there but could totally be unrelated. 

I approach the nurse and pull my bandana off my face because I see multiple people walking into employee entrances in plain clothes, no gloves or masks, and I feel stupid. She asks me if I have had a cough, fever, or shortness of breath. She asks me if I have traveled outside the country recently. She asks me if I have had contact with anyone who has covid-19 or anyone who has been exposed to anyone. Negatives. I ask her about the bandana. She says it’s pointless. She’s nice, though. 

A guy comes in behind us and I hear him say he can’t stop vomiting. Then he gags. I walk away quickly. 

I enter the ER waiting area, and it’s half it’s usual size. There’s a new partition that wasn’t there. I can see chair silhouettes but no people. The ER is also empty. The guys in intake both have masks and gloves. I want a mask, but I don’t ask. My mom still has hers on. Intake guy asks me if we put the gloves on in the car or the house.  He said as long as we put them on in the car we can keep them, but they’re pointless. I pull mine off. I try to make a joke about how empty it is, unless they’ve got everyone back in that new little room. One of the guys kinda gruffly says, “I’m not allowed to talk about that.” Weird vibe but okay. 

My mom is taken back to the - idk what it’s called - the room where they do vitals. The nurse is wearing a mask and gloves. She says that because she refuses flu shots, she’s required to wear the mask. She said when we get in back, most staff won’t have one on.  The N95 mask is bugging my mom. The nurse gives her the type they’re all wearing, the softer surgical looking type. I finally admit I wish I had a mask. The nurse tells me that anyone with any respiratory problems is immediately given a mask, and anyone who is immunocompromised. I’m neither. So I’m gloveless and maskless but it makes as much sense as anything else. I can wash my hands like a big girl. I do hold my breath when I walk by people and wish I hadn’t smoked all those years. Stupid stupid stupid. 

We are taken to a room, and it’s all normal back here. No masks on staff that I see. There aren’t gurneys of hacking people in the hallways. It’s very relaxed. At this point, no one else we will encounter looks like the guys from ET or are wearing anything different than a normal day. I listen to background convo while they ask my mom questions.  

One, hospital staff is very tired of people calling to ask if they should go to work or out to eat. They joke about it, but they’re over it. 

There is someone at the front desk getting a little loud. I’m only catching bits, he sounds professional and astute, so I can’t tell if he’s a doctor or a visitor. I catch, “we’re not doing any protective measures,” “just letting people walk right in,” “this is how it all starts,” “it can’t *all* be sore throats.” Eh. 

Currently, at least six people have been in the room with my mom. They have all used hand sanitizers upon entry. I have personally used enough hand sanitizer to have the beginning of a chemical burn under my rings. I really want a shower. My nose itches and I am dying to scratch it but won’t. I think I’ll burn my clothes. 

If anyone is interested and we wind up admitted to the hospital, I’ll update the procedure there as well. Me wanting to burn my clothes has nothing to do with the order of the staff and hospital. They have all been kind and professional. Something is just *off*.  I don’t like it.


Edit to add: Me writing this is mostly cathartic to keep my mind off my mother’s illness, but also in case anyone was curious what it was like. I am in Florida.",39,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fkqhs1/hospital_trip_unrelated_to_covid_current/

fkgyl6,CoronavirusUS,Popular Youtuber Phillip Defranco refuses to Quarantines. Possible Super-Spreader. Really should be stopped.,3/18/2020 9:10,"First off, Im a fan of Defranco and have been for 5-6 years.  Not trying to hate on the guy and dont want drama but this situation definitely needs to be called out.

Popular Youtuber Phillip Defranco on Mondays video admitted he brought his wife to the hospital for Covid-19 symptoms.  Doctor told him its highly possible but they cant afford to waste a test since shes young and good health.  According to CDC guidelines all those in close contact with a possible Covid-19 case should self-quarantine and an entire family should quarantine if one member is suspected to be positive. Phil is disregarding these precautions.

Phil is not obeying the quarantine recommendations.  He talks about doing last minute shopping over the weekend, filmed 2 videos in studio and plans to continue to film in studio.  In the same video he talks about Prime Minister Justin T being in self-quarantine due to his wife testing positive.  Theres no way he doesnt know he breaking the rules and putting others in danger.

His fans have stated ""He could be alone in Studio"". Ok but what if he gets hit by a drunk driver driving to the studio?  He would infect dozens of first responders and possible an entire ER. Its just dumb not to follow CDC guidelines at this point.  Him being a horrible example to millions is dangerous and irresponsible.

Basically this dude needs to be stopped.

For Sources Ill list Defrancos last two videos. Please watch them and verify for yourself.

His amendment would ""require a social security number for purposes of the child tax credit, and to provide the President the authority to transfer funds as necessary, and to terminate United States military operations and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan.""

The delayed [coronovirus relief bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201) provided ""paid sick leave for some workers, expanded unemployment compensation and nearly $1 billion in additional money to help feed children, homebound senior citizens and others.""

People need this help ASAP; every day delayed hurts Americans and increases the likelihood of COVID-19 spreading faster. Senator [Mitch McConnell](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-holds-presser-on-round-3-of-coronavirus-legislation), also from Kentucky, told fellow Republicans unhappy with the bill ""to gag and vote for it...to reassure the people around the country.""

Please [call](https://www.paul.senate.gov/connect/office-locations), [tweet](https://twitter.com/RandPaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Eprofile%3ARandPaul&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontactsenators.com%2Fkentucky%2Frand-paul), [Facebook message](https://m.facebook.com/RandPaul/), [DM](https://www.instagram.com/drrandpaul/), [e-mail](https://www.paul.senate.gov/connect/email-rand), and fax (202-228-1373) to demand he withdraw his amendment so the Senate can vote on the coronovirus bill Wednesday. 


You can say something like this:

*Dear Senator Paul, I am a constituent of ZIP CODE and am contacting you to insist you withdraw your ""Rights of Americans"" amendment. Doing so can allow immediate voting on H.R.6201. The high risk elderly and children need to be fed. The American people need monetary aid to ensure they stay home to stop the spread of COVID-19. Help your fellow citizens. Sincerely, NAME*

(Consider mentioning how the virus has affected you/your loved ones and if the bill directly applies to your situation)

in these difficult days, I feel the need to share my view and advice on the current Italian and international situation caused by the Coronavirus.

Certain to speak in the interest of us all, I ask you few minutes of your time to **read and reflect**:

\- In Europe, in general, and in Italy, in particular, we are living a period of deep civil and institutional stress: **our everyday life is threatened by a complex and unknown virus**.

 \- It is in these difficult times that it becomes **FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE ALL DO OUR PART.**

 \- **WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROBLEM REGARDS ALL OF** **US**, younger and older. Only because we can’t see the consequences that the spread of the virus is having on our life (present and future) it doesn’t mean it will not have consequences!!

\- Therefore, **I URGE YOU, I IMPLORE YOU**, for the sake of us all, **DO NOT FALL INTO THE COMFORTABLE TRAP** that goes like “*who cares*” “*I am young, it won’t affect me*” “*it’s all bullshit, it’s just a flu*” or “*it’s all a conspiracy*”.

 \- It is crucial that we all **STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS WE CAN**, and if we have to go out, **LET’S** **FOLLOW THE SECURITY RULES** at any time!

\- I appreciate how difficult is it to follow such a request: for those who must go to work, for those who see threatened their commercial activities, and for those who have obligations that cannot be postponed.

\- However, we must understand that is **paramount to SACRIFICE A PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE NEXT DAYS** so that everything may go back as it was, as soon as possible.

\-  I remain firmly convinced that **together we can stop it**.

 \- I do my part: **I’ll STAY HOME.**",35,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fgghgk/coronavirus_call_to_action/

fie2lf,CoronavirusUS,Chicago might be next NYC,3/14/2020 14:13,"
Hello, can we send emails to congressman/governor/media about the situation we are having now about coronavirus? Here is how serious it is now: 
Illinois’ confirmed patients’ number is ranked as No.8 in US based on data collected on 03/13/20. However, the new testing amount for IL in these two days (03/13 and 03/13) is ridiculously low. On 03/12 we had 51 new testings, and on 03/13, guess how many new testings we have? Only 23! While on 03/13, the whole country did 9156 new testings, IL’s new testing rank is only 36/50. Considering the population density of Chicago and the patients we have already had under this limited testing, if we keep having on this low testing amount, or comparatively low testing amount compared with nation’s, it would be really dangerous. WE CAN’T LET CHICAGO BE NEXT NYC. I saved my statistics in this google drive link, please reach out to congressmen/governor/media/any other ppl that you want to notify, ask for more testings and let people know how dangerous our situation is. Don’t panic but take actions to protect ourselves!

I keep hand sanitizer on me every day and use it before eating, but it clear to me that mist students aren't concerned about the Coronavirus at all.

>Pence said state and federal officials have “developed a plan which is being implemented this weekend to bring the ship into a non-commercial port. All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus and quarantined as appropriate. Those that require additional medical attention will also receive it.""

Pence also said “while the risk to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low, it is essential that we find ways to mitigate that risk to prevent the spread of coronavirus and I’m here today on behalf of President Trump to learn ways that this industry, the cruise line industry, can work with our health officials at the federal level, here at the state level with port authorities to give the passengers, communities and the country safe and healthy.”

Adam Goldstein, global chairman of the Cruise Lines International Association, told Pence it was the “commitment” of the cruise line industry to “work closely with government and to go above and beyond anything we are currently doing to screen even more stringently to prevent those who should not be allowed to board, to monitor and test and care for those who are on board and to transition and help pay for any sick guests or crew to move to locations staffed and equipped COVID-19 cases.""

“We will work aggressively with government to further develop and strengthen all necessary protocols for prevention, for detection and for care,” Goldstein said.

fio091,CanadaCoronavirus,"If you have 2-3 weeks worth of supplies already, STOP going out to the grocery stores",3/15/2020 3:30,"Here is my theory. All of this panic shopping has already increased the number of infected with people in such close proximity to one another. In 10-14 days I am expecting cases to skyrocket in Canada and the US as a direct result.


 I believe that food supply chains (and yes even toilet paper) will for the most part be available 2 weeks from now as less people go out due in part to already having supplies and in part to an increase in cases. In my opinion it would be wiser to use what you have now and wait for the crowds to die down before stocking up again. Of course that means PPE at that point. 


But for anyone panicking thinking they need months worth of supplies, my opinion is that it is a higher risk to go out now and deal with crowds than to use what you already have and give it some time to resupply.",249,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fio091/if_you_have_23_weeks_worth_of_supplies_already/

There  is a great deal of uncertainty right now with everything going on  around COVID-19, and so I wanted to reach out directly to you, our  customers.  
 

Our company’s purpose is to help Canadians live  life well. That seems particularly important today. We know you’re  relying on us for the comfort and necessity of food, pharmacy and  wellness in almost every community nationwide.  


**What does that really mean?**  


To start, you expect our supermarkets and Shoppers  Drug Mart pharmacies to be up and operational, with healthy environments  and teams ready to serve. We are delivering that with increased  sanitization practices, thoroughly cleaning high-touch areas like our  checkouts, cooler doors, and pharmacy counters three times a day. If you  have any concern, I hope you’ll ask your store owner or manager to  explain why you can shop with confidence.  


Our service to you also relies on people – your  friends and family working in your local store. These 190,000 colleagues  have families and concerns of their own, and we should all understand  how hard they are working. We are helping them stay informed and  prepared. Most importantly, we want them to protect themselves and in  turn protect you. That’s why we are retraining colleagues on safety  practices and instructing them to stay away from work if they are ill.  We know this will raise concerns around missed shifts and income. So,  we’re introducing safeguards that ensure they won’t lose pay for  COVID-19-related absences. People should not have to choose between  their income and good health.  


In spite of our precautions, we know some people are still feeling  anxious about public spaces. Many are turning to e-commerce options like  our PC Express food pick-up and delivery, and our Shoppers Drug Mart  e-prescription services. 

>**To support those customers, we’re staffing up,  eliminating PC Express pick-up fees, bringing the price of  home-delivered items down, and imagining new ways to help those in need  access food and medication. As always, Shoppers Drug Mart and  supermarket pharmacies will offer to deliver medication to your home  free of charge.**

And whether in-store or online, as customers stock up, some items will  be sold out. We know the frustration of an empty shelf and have assigned  an entire team to the challenge of rapidly re-stocking key food,  health, cleaning and comfort items. As they do so, our commitment is  that you will continue to find the same value-for-money in our stores,  no matter what happens in the coming weeks.  


All of this remains dynamic and we are ready for a range  of outcomes. We know it’s never been more important to help you keep  your family fed and healthy. And as an employer, retailer, and part of  Canadian communities from coast to coast, our responsibilities extend  beyond our doors. We are looking at ways to support our neighbours and  governments, asking questions like: Can our pharmacies help with  testing?; How can we continue to support in-school kids-hunger programs  if local classes are suspended?; What is the best way to feed those in  vulnerable communities?; and many, many more.  


We won’t solve every challenge. But, we promise to serve  our customers and communities as best we can, and to simply do the  right things in a complicated time.  


Sincerely,

fkby7i,CanadaCoronavirus,My experience @ a Covid testing centre (Toronto),3/18/2020 4:00,"I'm posting this in case anyone was wondering what it was like in the clinic. Before I went, I did do the self assessment tool online. I know the advice is to either contact your Dr or telehealth, but I got through to telehealth after 4hrs yesterday on hold to be told that the earliest someone would call back was Weds evening. I work in healthcare, and was advised to go to a centre. Some centres have appointments and some have walk ins (can google online if you are considering going to one). Remember if you are going- wear a mask, don't take transit. 

I arrived at the centre at 8:50am, it was set to open at 9am and there were already a few people in the line. Taped areas on the sidewalk indicated to keep your distance between each other. The wait was not too long and the process was quite streamlined and able to keep everyone clean and safe. Everyone has protective equipment on. 

First, when you enter the building, someone greets you- asks you to perform hand hygiene for 15seconds. Then they provide you a mask if you do not have one yet, and ask for you to have your health card ready. You are then directed to the next area, clearly marked where to stop and wait. You are then registered in the system with your healthcard. The process is that you drop your card into a basket, which is then taken by the clerk. No contact between the patient and the staff. The assessment areas are then set up in a long rectangle with dividers (think bathroom stall arrangement). You are called in when they are ready. They place a sticker with your information on your chest to identify you (like a hospital arm band). They will screen you using the assessment tool. There are 2 nurses – one that documents everything (no contact) and one that does the closer assessment. Temperature, oxygen and heartrate are checked. 

In my case, the Dr happened to be there and felt a swab was appropriate based on my symptoms, line of work, and close contact with a probable positive case. They mark the sticker on your chest to indicate you are to be swabbed and someone comes to pick you up from the booth. The sticker comes in handy for patient identification. You get directed into the end of the hall, where a door leads into a bigger space with pods for swabbing and then the exit. Once you get into a pod, the nurse performs the swab and you are directed to exit. Information about isolation and a mask is given to you. Security opens the door for you, so from start to finish, you have not touched any surfaces. 

It is planned out really well, hats off to everyone who set them up and are working there!",217,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fkby7i/my_experience_a_covid_testing_centre_toronto/

I want to share with everyone my story of potentially having COVID-19 and how our health care system is completely broken in dealing with this. If you think people are getting tested and being isolated from the rest of the public, think again. Think there are no cases in your community? Think again. If my story is any indication, this thing is way out of control already -- we just aren’t testing people so we don’t know about it.

We border a developed country with the healthcare system of a developing country and ten times our population. It's time to ban non-essential travel. I know that the numbers of infected people seem low right now, but because of the mathematical nature of exponential growth and the number of uninsured, homeless, and precariously employed Americans, the correct time to mandate a travel ban was February. Chinese corona cases are much less dangerous to Canadians because China is so much farther away and [Chinese citizens do not have visa free travel into Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Chinese_citizens). We cannot trust Trump to help his own people, so we must protect our own at his expense. **Canada First.**

# This is not a drill. This is a serious post, and the date of the U.S. travel ban will determine how many elderly loved ones you lose to the coronavirus.

We had been making sensible plans about limiting our risks on the trip and had pretty much talked ourselves into it all being okay. Then this morning our lovely daughter-in-law emailed us with travel tips for safer flying - and I realized I was very anxious about the trip.  Turns out my husband was worried, too - and we called our DIL and she was scared for us and apparently we had all been worried but were going to go ahead and do the trip because... I'm not sure? We were going to hurt someone's feelings or let someone down. 

We decided to postpone the trip and Facetime the grandchildren every day :)

I got online, cancelled the flights for future credit and cancelled the car rental.  Every step I took to free us from this trip made me feel happier and happier. We're out a couple of hundred bucks but I don't care because I'm so damned relieved! 

We went down the pub and celebrated because we don't have to travel tomorrow and we were both giggling we were so happy.

We have 73,000 hospital beds overall. A large chunk of this number is already currently in use daily. 

We are not ready for an outbreak in this country, which would overload our healthcare system as seen initially in Wuhan and currently in Iran and Italy. 

Northern Italy has 10% of confirmed cases in the ICU, this coming only two weeks after confirming their first death. 

The reported WHO CFR is 3.4%

1.3% for those between 50-59 

3.6% for those between 60-69 

8% for those between 70-79 

14.8% for those 80+

^^^ These numbers are largely based on data from China, who shutdown their economic output for over a month, placing hard quarantine measures on a city of 10M and restricting movement of another 700M. They had the ability to reinforce their response to this virus by reallocating the entire country’s medical and army personnel to the outbreak centre, in addition to having the labour to build hospitals rapidly and the industrial output to pump out necessary medical devices and instruments. Unfortunately Canada does not have the same capabilities China does. 

Don't forget 

2.4 million Canadians have heart issues

2.3 million Canadians have diabetes

3 million Canadians with Asthma

1.5 million Canadians with COPD

29% of Canadians above 20 are Obese

fk593k,CanadaCoronavirus,The Imperial College model that came out today helps explain governments' actions,3/17/2020 21:28,"I think I figured out why they are waiting so long to lock us down. Obviously, starting immediately would flatten the curve more. However, it would also require the intervention to last for longer than is practical.

The authors of the [Imperial College paper](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) that came out yesterday seem to think 3 months is reasonable to expect of Western civilians and the economy. If we start the lockdown before the infection has enough of a foothold in the population, the 3 month period won’t be long enough to catch the peak.

This is basically what’s happening in parts of China that locked down early — they have no new cases right now, but they’re going to have an explosion when they release people.

Because a vaccine will take 2 years, we can’t just lock down until then. According to the Imperial College paper, a lockdown of 3 months will reduce deaths by 50% if we catch the peak.

I think governments are timing their lockdowns based on predictions about the peak. They can’t admit this because it’s basically admitting killing a lot of people unnecessarily.

Governments don’t want to save the most number of people. They know that’s not practical anyway. They’re acting in the best interest of the surviving population, not of individuals. We have to balance the practicality of locking down millions of people with the number of lives it could potentially save.

The government knows we could flatten the curve if we started now, but they want to let it run its course a bit more.

TL;DR: Each day of quarantine's utility is proportionate to the number of cases going on during the quarantine, but this also increases the number of deaths. It's a balancing act of figuring out how best to “spend” the limited number of days you can reasonably quarantine people.

I would highly recommend reading the paper if you are interested.

fcbhyv,CanadaCoronavirus,Ontario: Get Ford to re-instate mandatory sick leave pay to protect us all.,3/2/2020 20:43,"We need to force Doug Ford / the PCs to re-instate sick leave pay. Ford cut worker rights ([https://pressprogress.ca/doug-ford-is-gutting-labour-laws-eliminating-sick-days-and-cancelling-raises-for-minimum-wage-workers/](https://pressprogress.ca/doug-ford-is-gutting-labour-laws-eliminating-sick-days-and-cancelling-raises-for-minimum-wage-workers/))

including  mandatory sick leave pay. The people most affected by these roll-backs of worker rights are low-paid workers who work in the service sector--retail, restaurants, etc. Many live life on the financial edge and can't afford to take a few weeks off without pay. They will be forced to go to their jobs, and will spread the virus if they go to work sick. Companies don't have to pay workers anything for sick days now. 

Write to your member of provincial parliament (MPP) *now* and tell them to immediately not just re-instate, but ***increase*** ***number of paid sick leave days*** for workers in our province.  Even if you have benefits yourself, you will be impacted by this roll-back of workers rights by Conservatives in our province. 

Tell your MPP that Ford's labour laws put all of us at risk and they must do better. If you have a Conservative MPP, tell them what you think of their policies towards workers in Ontario. If your MPP is not Conservative, tell them that as the opposition they need to get this in front of parliament every single session until it is changed.

Today, they announced 133 more deaths and 1326 new cases. More worryingly, they now have 650 cases in ICU.  Just a few weeks ago, Italy had only a handful of cases. Keep in mind, Canada only has about 3k ICUs across the country, less than the U.S per capita.

We're sleep walking towards an incredibly dangerous situation.

What are we doing here to prepare for this kind of scenario? Are we planning on dramatically expanding our ICU capacity?

fi8ss4,CanadaCoronavirus,Awkward experience wearing mask at the clinic...mask stigma really is a thing here.,3/14/2020 7:11,"Context: I'm pregnant, and have been working from home for nearly a month with my husband. We haven't travelled for a year, and have essentially self-quarantined out of precaution for the last two weeks. We've been perfectly healthy, free of cold/flu/etc, and we want to keep it that way.

I went to the clinic for a routine prenatal checkup. My husband and I were wearing surgical masks out of precaution because we would be around quite a few people within close proximity.

As we were waiting for my turn in the sitting area, I noticed that we were the only people wearing masks, and no one else did.

In about 5 minutes, a staff came to us, and started asking questions.

""Do you experience flu-like symptoms? Have you recently travelled? Have you..."" etc, etc.

We answered no, and said that we were only wearing masks out of self-protection.

She said something along the lines of ""are you sure?"", with a suspicious look on her face.

Puzzled at her doubts, we assured our answer.

She then asked who we were seeing, and I said the nurse.

Then she said, slowly, with a face of half-belief ""well, thank you for being honest"", as if we were trying to hide something.

Out of all the people sitting there, we, even though we've clearly taken great responsibility for the extra gears, got grilled.

I get it, wearing masks make us really stick out in a crowd. But that at least should show that we have a sense of responsibility, either for ourselves since we are healthy, or for others, suppose if we were really coming down with something.

There were a couple of people seldomly coughing in the waiting space. It would make a lot more sense to go to them and ask if they'd like to wear a mask instead.

I felt flustered by the experience, and a bit embarrassed. I'd rather see more people exercising extra caution than not, even when they are not sick. But if that's the attitude people have when seeing others wearing masks, I don't know what kind of message it delivers. 🤷‍♀️

**Edit**: we waited for 10-15 minutes or so, and out of everyone who were there, many of them whom arrived after me, there were a few who were *actually* having one or two muzzled/wet-sounding coughs, who didn't even wear any masks, and I noticed one didn't even cover his mouth while coughed. They were *not* inquired at all about their own lack of protection/symptoms/travel history/etc. If it's the symptoms that would prompt the questionnaire, wouldn't they be prioritized instead because they *actually* displayed even the littlest potential symptoms? If the prompt of the questioning was due to the display of symptoms, and I coughed behind my masks too, that would make perfect sense. But I was just sitting there with my husband, quietly, and spoke to each other gently a few times. Zero coughs. Zero clearing throat even. Zero sneezes. So what else prompt it? The sole act of wearing masks. That's the part that really frustrated me, knowing that I was hearing coughs from others. No one else, even the ones who coughed, were questioned while we all waited.",81,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fi8ss4/awkward_experience_wearing_mask_at_the_clinicmask/

This doctor came into contact with 14 patients, 5 colleagues and her husband. I assume she also interacted with friends, neighbors, grocery clerks, restaurant workers etc. Those 5 colleagues (one of whom is currently out of the country) probably saw patients as well. Luckily, this doctor knew enough to get tested right away, but you can see even in this case, how many people were potentially exposed.

Now, how many students, colleagues, parents etc. does a teacher see in a day?

fkbr9o,CanadaCoronavirus,It's here. Influenza-like illness activity tracker shows a huge spike in respiratory-related emergency room visits in Toronto and all of Ontario.,3/18/2020 3:49,"See this link: [http://mapper.kflaphi.ca/ilimapper/analysis](http://mapper.kflaphi.ca/ilimapper/analysis)

This is a screengrab from looking at Influenza-like activity data for Toronto. We've seen a 153% increase in respiratory related emergency room visits in the past week. This isn't flu, because as you can see, the flu peak was on its way down from a spike around the holidays.

If you do a bit of math using these numbers, you can estimate there are about 484 cases that have presented to Toronto Public Health that are not flu (2421 x 20%– I assumed flu accounted for about 5% of total visits, because that's what it was prior to the spike).

Make no mistake: it's here, and it's spreading. We're running low on test kits and swabs, so it will take time to reflect this in the data.

I work as a Regional Sous Chef for one of city’s largest restaurants in Toronto.  We hold multiple stores in the area, and across both Canada and the US.  

After hours of discussion and meetings this weekend, we have begun preparations for lockdown, which means all employees will be laid off, myself included, once the announcement is made by the Canadian government.  This obviously isn’t an secret as everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop.  

But the reason I posted this thread is that I was able to convince our corporate team to allow our employees to take all perishable items home with then, as well as immediate tabulation and calculation of tip outs by one of our HR managers.  Just wanted to let others know that our employees will be taken care of.  

As I can’t release the name of the restaurant, I can only hope this example will be shared and passed on to inspire other businesses to do the same for their low income employees.  

Please be safe out there.  Good luck all!",68,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fjmpay/my_restaurants_are_preparing_for_shutdown/

fjva8e,CanadaCoronavirus,My grandmother is refusing to self-isolate after travel and has visited a few high risk areas. What can I do?,3/17/2020 8:01,"My grandmother has just returned from a trip to Las Vegas on the 14th, she decided to take advantage of the low prices and risk her health. 
She was gone for 5 days and did travel by plane. Now that she is back she wants the family to come pick up gifts she had gotten us. I refuse and advised my family to do the same, thankfully my mother is taking my advice. Unfortunately a few aunts/uncles (including my heavily pregnant aunt who is important later) have gone to see her. 

Yesterday morning she stated she was feeling well and went into work (a emergency receiving home) for children ages 6mo-14yrs and same thing today. 

She is not taking the government recommended decision of self isolating as she believes she’s fine. Even after me pleading on the phone and sending her multiple articles proving symptoms do not appear right away and could take up to 2 weeks.

Now for the icing on the cake, my pregnant aunt gave birth to her baby this morning and guess who was the first to visit, Gma. This was early in the morning, I’m aware that as of this afternoon it was announced no one is to visit hospitals or care facilities with high risk patients unless it is absolutely necessary. 

There are many pictures of her holding the baby and my aunt/uncle were well aware of the risks with letting her visit. 

Perhaps I’m just being paranoid, as I am a hypochondriac, but I can’t bare the thought of my brand new infant niece catching the virus. My grandma has not shown any symptoms but it is possible it’s too early to tell. Is there anything I can do or someone I can speak with as my grandma will listen to no one.

Yes, we have a good healthcare system, though our hospitals have less than 2.2 beds/1000 people where the US has 2.7; yes, we survived SARS in 2003 without quarantine, though despite it being more deadly, it was less contagious and didn't have asymptomatic transmission and was thus easier to isolate; yes, we've been preparing for something like this for years, but nobody in charge is reacting as if this is urgent.

WHO is screaming that this is not a drill. *Mike Pence* disagreed with Trump's ""hunch"" and misinformation. Nobody has consensus on this. So... Why? Why isn't anyone reacting and what's going to happen to us? I don't think Canada's any more special than any of the other countries who've been infected - according to the WHO, Italy has the 6th-best healthcare system in the world, better than Canada or the US, and look at them.

So... What do you think? Should we be more worried, or is even this post a form of fear mongering? How can I get people to take this more seriously? What do we do?

fjy6h1,CanadaCoronavirus,Government refusing testing,3/17/2020 11:20,"My girlfriend has begun to show symptoms of Covid-19. She called the hotline at 811 and after 2 hours on hold was told to self-isolate but refused a test. They said they will not test anyone unless they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive. when asked what ""close contact"" means she was told that someone in your household or your physician is what they consider close contact. Just to be clear, unless you live with someone who has tested positive they will not test you, so people in your household can only be tested if people in your household have been tested. It's a definition catch 22. Furthermore, when asked if \*I\* should continue going to work she was told that yes I should go to work until I show symptoms. If she is positive, I am positive and could be contagious without symptoms for some time. I am incredibly saddened by the incompetence of our government. They should have shut everything down yesterday, how many more people will be infected before we close down all non-esential services and mandate isolation?

Outbreaks are the same way. The earlier you act, the sooner things are back to normal, the less damage it did, and the less you had to spend. The larger it is allowed to grow, the longer you need measures for once you start them, the more damage is done, and the more you need to spend.

If we were to act at maximum right now, I wouldn't be surprised to see things in many ways back to normal as soon as 2 months from now or even sooner.

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from outbreak zones such as Seattle, Australia, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research.

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

CONTEXT:

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through [Herculean efforts](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1237020518781460480).

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [100,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep. That means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

This is [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Time to go to war.

IMPORTANT:

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and possibly breathing as well** (*see bullet point below*). But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). [**Here's**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) **an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).
* **\[NOT PEER REVIEWED\]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing as well. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: ""The findings \[of the study\] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now."" [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer. Also please note that this study has not been peer-reviewed, but due to the implications is included here out of an abundance of caution.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/fgj062/joe_rogan_experience_1439_michael_osterholm/fk4t45b/) speak for themselves.
* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).
* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).) **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).
* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.**
* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).
* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

PSYCHOLOGY:

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.
* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.
* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.
* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca).
* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

RISK REDUCTION:

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/).
* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).
* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO.
* Carry disinfectant with you.
* Do not shake hands.
* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.
* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.
* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.
* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones.
* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.
* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house.
* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/).
* Stay away from crowds.
* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.
* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.
* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.
* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.
* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.
* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.
* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.
* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))
* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.
* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.
* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.
* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

INCUBATION PERIOD:

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.
* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days.
* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""
* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China.)

* Fever (87.9%)
* Dry cough (67.7%)
* Fatigue (38.1%)
* Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)
* Shortness of breath (18.6%)
* Sore throat (13.9%)
* Headache (13.6%)
* Joint pain (14.8%)
* Chills (11.4%)

COMORBIDITIES:

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include those who meet *any* of the following conditions:

* People 60 years of age and older
* Diabetes
* Hypertension
* Cardiovascular disease
* Chronic respiratory disease
* Heart, lung or kidney disease
* Cancer
* Those with weakened immune systems
* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/fgj062/joe_rogan_experience_1439_michael_osterholm/fk4t45b/) of source)
* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking/vaping](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""** Additional: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source.](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds))

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

MORTALITY RATE:

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age[% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/)[% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm)[Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm)0-912.0%0.9%010-1911.6%1.2%0.1%20-2913.5%8.1%0.2%30-3915.6%17.0%0.2%40-4915.6%19.2%0.4%50-5915.0%22.4%1.3%60-6910.4%19.2%**3.6%**70-794.7%8.8%**8.0%**80+1.8%3.2%**14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

ADDITIONALS:

* It's still far too early to know for sure, but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is estimated to be 0.94% (0.37%–2.9% with a 95% CI) ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Though [here](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) is a recent Slate piece that mentions a CFR between 0.2 to 0.4. South Korea, after doing 140,000 tests, reports a CFR of 0.6% ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html))
* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.
* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. (**[**Source**](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)**).**
* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).
* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w)
* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful.

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes.

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA.

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, or the one over in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), both of which will be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).",63,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fhgdln/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/

Maybe they're worried that if everything were shut down all at once, there would be so much combined resistance that enforcement resources would be overwhelmed.

In case you think I'm paranoid, a pocket of resistance has already emerged on Reddit.  When Toronto imposed a moratorium on evictions one Redditor immediately posted saying he's thinking of not paying rent even though he can afford it, simply because he can't be evicted and not paying rent would enable him to hoard money.  No, it's not the ""resistance"" thinking of where people simply refuse to do what the government asks, but it's a trouble spot that the government will have to address before it moves on to the next stage of the shutdown.

Today we've had a further increase of 24 positive cases for Ontario, with a large increase in the ""pending"" status for a lot cases. Its pretty clear now that the ""pending"" status on the transmission column most likely means that the case was a community transmission. This can be further reinforced with the sharp increase of cases under investigation *even though we're testing more than a thousand cases daily*. Officials are trying to test every person that's came in contact with the community transmission cases.

Now its further clear why the Ontario page updates each day and replaces the previous day's case information with only the current day. When they first switched to the new format, I found this to be strange as it only included the case information for that particular day, the previous day's information was wiped. Now I realized that this is so that they never have to resolve the pending status on each of the specific cases, they're going to be erased the next day anyways. They're not going to clear up whether or not these cases are actually community transmission. Thankfully I've been able to keep track of the case information including the fact that these cases are still ""pending"" even after days.

***

I’ve been trying to compile information about the strain coronavirus is putting on medical staff globally, and why we must provide as much support as possible to our amazing medical community in Canada.

Obviously, we as non-medical citizens can be most supportive right now by keeping ourselves safe as possible, and that should be our biggest takeaway from what doctors are urging globally: **Stay Home!**

**As for the coming weeks and months, we are about to witness amazing feats of emotional, mental and physical strength from our nurses, first responders and doctors.**

If and when there is anything citizens can do to help in anyway please ask.

If there is anything I am missing please feel free to contribute other articles or posts that you may feel is relevant to the medical effort towards COVID-19

One to two alcohol per household is probably enough already. I'm not sure if this is the same, but I've heard my mom says she saw people getting 10 bags of rice (10kg/each bag) at once a couple weeks ago so I'm just imagining it'll be the same with sanitizer/everything else as well.

Leave some for everyone. I've been trying to find any kind of sanitizer or rubbing alcohol since a few days ago, went to 20+ stores and I can't find a single one. Even went to the super markets that are an hour away from my home and still don't have any luck.
I'm probably still find if I lock myself at home and I can live without those, but imagine people who actually need it. What if they can't find it and they've got COVID-19? Will they think it's okay to be not isolating themselves at home all the time since everyone is so prepared and they only got it because they don't have enough sanitizing supplies?

This might be a bit extreme and a bad example, but my point is I really feel how people are panicking and stock a whole bunch of inventory at home is also not helping with the situation... And it's a waste if someone has a whole lot while the other has nothing and is in need of those. So please clam down and think if you really need that much of stocking at home.

My husband works at a small office in Halton with people who commute from downtown Toronto and Mississauga. Everyone in his office thinks he is insane for being as cautious as he is about the virus. We have stocked up on our supplies and follow updates daily. We have shared scientific videos and articles from top reputable professionals in the field, who all say the same thing--take this seriously, goddamn it! Avoid large, densely populated, enclosed events. Avoid non essential travel.

He found out today that one of his coworkers is heading to Vegas in the next few days because she can't cancel without losing money, and another coworker is helping his partner set up at the green living show this weekend in Toronto. My husband is like... W... T.... F....

So what does one do when it is the people they come in contact with on the daily, claim that they won't ""live in fear"", which apparently means doing exactly what scientists and doctors say not to do....

We have 2 kids who BOTH have puffers because when they get any kind of cough (like croup), they NEED them. My youngest is 2 and has had to go to emerg numerous times for epinephrine while battling everyday colds and viruses.

&#x200B;

I go to school Alberta, we have around 1100 students ( grade 10-12 ). The sanitary conditions in my school are absolutely horrible, there is grime and all sorts of stuff layering every single surface of the school. Mrs. Hinshaw's choice to keep schools open has put everything out of whack here. My mother has RA and takes immune blocking medication, Im afraid due to the sanitary conditions at our school the virus has very good potential to spread from peer to peer. Im not scared of getting the virus, im scared of giving it to my mother. 

&#x200B;

I dont get why we cannot follow the lead of every other nation and province and close our school and switch to online classes. All of our sporting events have been cancelled ( 30 or less people attend these ) and they decided to fold up 1 table in our cafeteria so that there is 250 seats in the cafeteria ( students are just standing instead of sitting at the table. there is easily 300+ students in one room ) not to mention every time we switch periods 1000+ kids are walking throughout the halls with less then 1ft of space inbetween eachother.

Today we saw an increase of 32 new positive cases a slight decrease in the increase. I've seen some people saying its due to the limited testing, however if we look at the numbers, we actually tested more people today than yesterday. So with an increased number of tests, we saw a slight decrease in the increase, take that how you will. 

There's really nothing else to say other than the massive amount of ""pending"" status on the case information. It feels like the people working on the website have just giving fuck all. Why have so many columns if you're not going to bother to write down the facts?

fiq0im,CanadaCoronavirus,Big 5 Bank employee frustrated with horrible WFH policy,3/15/2020 5:36," Throwaway, for obvious reasons.  


I'm a Big 5 Canadian Bank employee, who works in their I.T. division. I'm basically a business analyst. All my work is done in either outlook (emails), Excel, or Word. And 90% of my meetings are done through a teleconferencing app (Lync or Skype). And I use a laptop exclusively.  


We got our Pandemic-related WFH policy late last week and it was pathetic. Half of the employees can WFH. The other half must come into the office. The reason was something along the lines of ""their VPN can't handle it if everyone works from home"". Guess which half I fell into?  


Which strikes me as pathetic since even the smallest of the Big 5 earned about 5 billion in profit last year!  


Is anyone else really frustrated with their workplace's WFH policy, going into next week?  


I know some jobs you can't do from home (i.e. car salesperson) but my job is literally: white collar, sit in front of a computer all day, back-office, no contact with customers, etc.",49,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fiq0im/big_5_bank_employee_frustrated_with_horrible_wfh/

As we come to Friday the 13th, Ontario increases its positive cases by another 20 cases. But as we look at the numbers of cases being tested, we can see the quantity steadily rising. However, even with the large amounts of tests each day, it is unable to stop the tide of the number of cases under investigation. Continuing to grow each day even with the increase of testing capabilities. An important key to focus on is Ontario's 67th case, a man in his 80s. He has been hospitalized and is now the only case in Ontario to do so. 

Following the closure of public schools yesterday, various universities and colleges in Ontario are closing as well. Examples like the University of Toronto, York University, Seneca College, etc. 

The number of cases today seemed to have overwhelmed even the personnel updating the website as now shortforms are used instead of their original names. (""Peel Public Health"" is now just ""Peel""). We also have an increase of ""pending status"" on cases, from the 75th case to the 79th case, we have no information on the case besides the fact that they are in Toronto. This is worrisome as it almost feels like that they're trying to hide the information.

If I could post up on a website that he has COVID-19 and some stats ('unofficial stats') then it would be very helpful to get some more data out there, since testing is few and far between.

If there are multiple pages, please let me know. The more data out there the better!

Now I am off to make some ginger tea and other herbals and hope for the best as we ride through this.

It seems like countries like Israel have the right priorities in place and Israel is currently at 42 cases vs. 67 here in Canada. Why isn't Canada being more proactive?

First thing we have to talk about is the increased updates that the Ontario website is giving out. Previously the website only updated once during weekdays, now they are updating twice a day every single day. So credit where credit is due, good on Tim for putting in the extra hours to keep us updated. 

The next thing is the addition of the new cases table on the website. Now you can see the information of the new cases like age, gender, location, hospital, transmission type, and status. Really great table to make such information easy to view. Unfortunately this only affects new cases, so it doesn't affect previous cases but if you look through my previous posts, I've given information on each case. 

While the table on the website itself says there's only 30 positive cases, that portion was only updated in this morning, below you'll see the update in the afternoon where we have another positive case. Going up to 31. 

So we first start from [last night] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-case-of-covid-19-2.html) where we have the addition of two new positive cases. The first is a woman in her 60s who came back from France. She presented herself to Scarborough Health Network - General Site and is now in self-isolation. The second is a man in his 60s who returned from Washington D.C. and. He presented himself to North York General Hospital and is now in self-isolation. 

Moving on to today, we have four additional cases. However all four seem stable and are all in self-isolation. The first is a man in his 50s who came back from Germany and presented himself to Brampton Civic Hospital. The second is a man in his 80s who came back from Iran and presented himself to North York General Hospital.

The third case is a woman in her 70s who came back from Iran and presented herself to North York General Hospital. The last case is a woman in her 30s who was actually infected through H2H transmission and presented herself to Brampton Civic Hospital. It is unsure who she was infected by as there was no information provided for that.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can tell, it comes from this report from China: [http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51)

>Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30–79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered **mild (80.9%)**.

How do they define mild?

>The severity of symptoms variable was categorized as mild, severe, or critical. **Mild included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases.** Severe was characterized by dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24–48 hours. Critical cases were those that exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.

Now, I can't speak for you, but for me, I have never had an acute condition on the level of mild pneumonia. So, **I could have a ""mild"" case of COVID-19 and yet be the sickest I've been in my entire life**. I believe this is probably true for a lot of people.

Is this reason to panic, no, you become very sick but you get through it. It's not a death sentence (like the disease in Contagion, for example).

I'm finding it hard to keep up with all of the international news on COVID-19 and I suspect some of you are as well. As Italy has been getting a lot of media attention (for good reason), I've heard comments from others thinking that they are in some type of outlier situation. When I pointed out that other large European countries are on exactly the same path and look to be 1 to 1.5 weeks behind, this surprised others. To illustrate what I'm saying, see the graph below. Once countries hit about 100 cases, the trajectory has been almost identical. As the USA is quickly becoming an Italy-like situation (finding deaths before clusters) and they are our friendly neighbour to the south, this will be our reality soon as well regardless of what happens with air travel from overseas.

If you don't tell small business to keep employees home, they won't.

I'm working today, in a service industry that definitely isn't essential because my boss says work is on, and I need to get paid. I'm one of 8ish technicians working today. Im scheduled to work this week and next. 

It's embarrassing to be out, let alone visiting 4-5 homes a day. (not to mentioning the calls for these appointments are still coming in. Yesterday we denied work to someone not self isolating after admitting they were traveling, which is good I guess) 

I truly believe as a nation we are responsible in times like this. The bound between Canadians really is comparable to few, we all want to keep each other safe. So how do we responsibly shut down non essential small business, given small business is what's drives Canada? A lot of the owners know nothing but work - it flows through them.

fc4byl,CanadaCoronavirus,"An excellent and factual summary of a WHO report after the organization sent a team of 25 international experts to China. Comorbidities, symptoms, mortality, and other nuance. Here are their findings, including a link to the original report.",3/2/2020 9:27,"(This excellent and factual summary was originally posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fbt49e/the_who_sent_25_international_experts_to_china/) earlier today)

The WHO has sent a team of international experts to China to investigate the situation, including Clifford Lane, Clinical Director at the US National Institutes of Health. Here is [the press conference on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0q1XMRKYM) and the [final report of the commission as PDF](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:

- When a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

- 5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require [artificial respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_ventilation). Another 15% need to breathe in [highly concentrated oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy) - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

- China can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

- The vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

- The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

- An examination of [44,672 infected people in China](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

- Healthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to [treat 0.4% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) at the same time - other developed countries [have between 0.1% and 1.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.

- Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

- Age: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

Age | % of population | % of infected | Fatality 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0,9% | 0 as of now
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | 3.6%
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | 8.0%
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | 14.8%

*Read: Out of all people who live in China, 13.5% are between 20 and 29 years old. Out of those who were infected in China, 8.1% were in this age group. This does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected. It means that the likelihood of someone at this age to catch the infection is somewhat lower compared to the average. And of those who caught the infection in this age group, 0.2% died.*

- Gender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

- The new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

- Since the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining ([shown here as a graph](https://imgur.com/a/6IL4xhv)) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,"" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. [Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0q1XMRKYM&feature=youtu.be&t=1508).

- One of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

*Finally, a few direct quotes from the report:*

""China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",42,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fc4byl/an_excellent_and_factual_summary_of_a_who_report/

The most drastic thing to happen today is the incredible increase in testing from yesterday and from since the beginning. I've already noted the tripling of cases under investigation in yesterday's post but today's increase dwarfs that. It seems that the criteria for testing is being loosened as Ontario ramps up testing for a larger number of people. 

This ties in to the 6 new positive cases we've had today, with the first one being very key here. Unlike other cases that we've had, this one's cause is unknown. The man in his 50s presented himself to Health Sciences North but he had no travel history nor did he have any close contact with previous confirmed cases. This could be the result of a community transmission, in which the man was infected by another unconfirmed but positive case. However, there is a silver lining in this situation. The fact that they tested this man without his prior contact to confirmed cases or his lack of travel history means that Ontario is no longer strictly testing anymore. With a more widespread testing method, Ontario will be able to better inform themselves of how many actual infected there are. As a result, we could see a large increase of positive cases during the next few days. 

The rest of the cases today all had prior travel history, with the majority of them coming in from the US. 

* The second case today is woman in her 30s with a travel history to Egypt. She presented herself to Mackenzie Health hospital and is now in self-isolation
* The third case today is man in his 30s with a travel history to the US. He presented himself to Toronto Western hospital and is now in self-isolation
* The fourth case today is man in his 40s with a travel history to Austria. He presented himself to Ottawa Hospital and is now in self-isolation
* The fifth case today is woman in her 30s with a travel history to the US. She presented herself to Hamilton Health Sciences and is now in self-isolation
* The sixth case today is woman in her 40s with a travel history to the US. She presented herself to St Joseph’s Health Centre and is now in self-isolation

Why are politicians and public health leaders not being pressed on this? I feel as if we are missing a golden opportunity to limit community spread. At this point, any travel outside of Canada within 14 days of symptom onset should be screened.

Why is it that some hospitals have been permitted to test outside of the case definition? I work in health care, and public health has rejected several physician requests for testing because cases do not meet current case definition in Ontario.

fkicfh,CanadaCoronavirus,PSA: things you may not think of cleaning...,3/18/2020 10:46,"I just made a comment about washing your veggies with soap and water (someone rightly added vinegar as an option) and it shocked a few people,  so I figured it would be a good place to list things we may not think about to wash. 

1. Fruits and veggies - use soap or vinegar to cut through everything.

2. Your eyeglasses! Including the arms and everything. Every last part of them.

3. Doorknobs and handles in your house.  I spray mine down with a diluted bleach solution and let them air dry. 

4. Your mailbox.  I love my mailman but he touches everyone else's mailbox. Ew. 

5. Keys. Just be careful of any electronic parts. 

6. Your phone. I know people probably already know this but it's worth a mention. 

7. Other groceries. Some are more difficult but you can do stuff like spray down tins and wipe packages.",42,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fkicfh/psa_things_you_may_not_think_of_cleaning/
fkfufy,CanadaCoronavirus,"184 positive cases, 5 cases resolved, 1 case deceased, 1567 cases under investigation and 9415 negative cases in Ontario, Canada. An increase of 12 positive cases from yesterday.",3/18/2020 7:55,"[Source] (https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus#section-0)

[Graph of positive cases] (https://i.imgur.com/a4gTZKX.png)

Today was pretty hectic, we had a small increase of 12 positive cases, the first COVID-19 death and the [emergency declaration from the Ontario government] (https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2020/3/ontario-enacts-declaration-of-emergency-to-protect-the-public.html)

While people have noted that the increase of 12 cases from yesterday's 32 cases seems to mean that infection could be dropping, please note the number of cases tested today. Our testing capability have dropped hard today, nearing half that of yesterday's. It is unsure what the reason for this large decrease of testing but that definitely plays a part in the reduction of positive cases today. 

The other thing to talk about is the first [COVID-19 death] (https://globalnews.ca/news/6689357/ontario-coronavirus-death/) in Ontario. Case #186 is a 77 year old man who came in close contact with an infected individual. The main problem was that Case #186's status was detected post-death, so they only knew the man had the virus after he was already dead. This of course brings into the question on why the man was not tested earlier. Especially since Case #186 and the other infected individual were living together so he should've been the first person to be tested. Really unfortunate situation here.

fiw435,CanadaCoronavirus,"Nearly every ""case"" reported is ""travel related"" - but why bother mentioning that?",3/15/2020 12:50,"Nearly every ""case"" reported on CBC is ""travel related"" - but why bother mentioning that since testing is reserved for those people in Canada who:

1. Have travelled
2. Have symptoms

Nearly nobody gets tested unless they fit the above criteria.

It's not the governments fault that people are getting infected, but wouldn't it be worth the money to have done some random sample testing of the population and see if you find any asymptomatic infected people walking around?    Information from random sampling would have helped a lot to determine if and WHEN to shut down schools and so forth.

A few things like this have bothered me for over a month - where is the logic?

PS - **one more thing** \- Hand Sanitizer could help to ""flatten the curve"" - but it has been OUT OF STOCK for over a month.    Can't the government $1 Billion bring us some HAND SANITIZER?

""My apologies in advance for another COVID-19 post, but this issue is too big to not say anything.

Here are the latest numbers (As of 03/17/2020) that I found for the major countries involved (minus China, including Canada). [https://imgur.com/gallery/VCAWuoE](https://imgur.com/gallery/VCAWuoE)

As you can see, we are very lucky to still be relatively early on the COVID-19 timeline. But time will continue to move forward and it will continue to do so very quickly.

This means that it is absolutely ESSENTIAL for every one of us to do EVERYTHING that we possibly can to prevent our curve from following those of Italy and potentially many other countries in the upcoming weeks.

As a physician, I urge you to PLEASE think of others as we manage this together. Think of your aging parents, your elderly grandparents, your neighbour who has cancer and is on chemotherapy, the child with a primary immunodeficiency, your friend who works in the hospital, and everyone else in your community.

WE CAN ALL STILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TRAJECTORY!!!

\- PLEASE DO NOT TRAVEL

\- PLEASE SELF-ISOLATE FOR 14 DAYS IF YOU ARE SICK IN ANY WAY OR JUST RETURNED FROM ABROAD

\- PLEASE PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING (we have postponed our own wedding so whatever social event you have coming up...CANCEL IT!)

\- PLEASE THINK OF WAYS TO ALLOW YOUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME

\- PLEASE. JUST. STAY. HOME.

\- PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS AND NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE IF YOU DO HAVE TO GO OUT

\- PLEASE CHECK IN WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS IF THEY ARE SELF-ISOLATING TO SEE IF THEY NEED ANYTHING

We need to follow in South Korea’s trajectory in order to beat this. However, unfortunately we do not have access to the level of mass population testing that they have. We also do not live on an island and despite border closure to non-essential travel with the US, we will continue to see overflow from their side. THUS, it is even more important for everyone to follow these recommendations diligently.

Many of my friends are already working hard on the front lines of this pandemic and many more will join them soon. LET US ALL DO OUR PART so that we DO NOT run out of VENTILATORS or ICU BEDS or MASKS or GLOVES or DOCTORS or NURSES to take care of those in our communities who will need the most help very soon.

LET'S TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

Wishing everyone health and safety ❤️

P.S. One of the complications of social distancing is that there is now a shortage of blood donations so if you do have to go outside to go to work or grocery shopping, please consider donating blood at Canadian Blood Services on your way home so that we do not run out.

What a surprise, I didn't expect to be posting during the weekend since the website supposedly only updated during weekdays. However the table seems to have been updated today, its really quite a coincidence since I don't usually check the website over the weekend. Thank you Tim for coming in during the weekend to update the stats, much appreciated it. 

With the addition of 3 new cases, we turn our attention back to [Friday at 6:23pm] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-5.html), where we find the addition to 2 cases. These were not placed in the Friday row since it was updated at 10:30am. 

The first case is a man in his 20s who returned from Italy and presented himself to Mount Sinai Hospital. He is now discharged and in self-isolation. The second is a woman in her 60s who came back from Iran and presented herself to Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital. She was also discharged and remains in self-isolation

Moving on to today, we have [another case] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-6.html) of a woman in her 40s that came back from Colorado. She presented herself to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and was discharged to remain in self-isolation. 

Its actually strange that the table updated itself for today, since it did say that it would only update on weekdays. Furthermore, the increase of a single case doesn't really warrant the update since the increase of last weekend's 11 cases didn't cause the website to update during the weekend. Now here comes the really strange part, the table on the website itself says that it was updated on 10:30am today, however if you look at the [new case today] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-cases-of-covid-19-6.html), it was only posted at 1:10pm today. But the table that was updated at 10:30am today already counted today's case that was actually confirmed at 1:10pm. Interesting to think about.

### Ontario Making it Easier for Public to Stay Informed about COVID-19

#### Dedicated Website Will Now Include Twice Daily Updates on New Cases

March 9, 2020 9:30 A.M.

[Ministry of Health](https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en)

TORONTO — As COVID-19 evolves, Ontario is taking further steps to inform the public on the status of the virus across the province.

Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on the development of COVID-19 since initial cases of a viral pneumonia were reported in China in late December 2019. Every weekday at 10:30 a.m. Ontario has been updating its [dedicated web page](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus) with the most up-to-date information on the status of cases in Ontario, including: the number of cases currently under investigation; and the number of confirmed positive, negative and resolved cases.

To enhance these efforts, the [web page](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus) will now be updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week. The web page will also now include general information on each new confirmed case of COVID-19, including gender, age, public health unit, hospital (if applicable), where acquired and status. The information provided will reflect what has been confirmed by local public health authorities at that time. This information will be provided in lieu of the news releases the province has been issuing and will be supplemented by additional details provided by individual public health units.

""The health and well-being of the people of Ontario is our top priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Although the risk remains low, we are enhancing our reporting protocols as we continue to take decisive steps to protect the public. Ontarians can be fully confident that we are providing the information they need in order to protect themselves and their families.""

Currently, the virus is not circulating locally. However, given the global circumstances, last week Ontario implemented an [enhanced response structure](https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-implementing-enhanced-measures-to-safeguard-public-from-covid-19.html) to formally bring together experts across the health sector to provide clinical expertise and experience to implement provincial and regional plans. This will ensure the province is ready to contain and respond to a COVID-19 outbreak.

In addition to the daily updates to the [website](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus), Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 at the regularly scheduled [media briefings](https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/02/time-change-chief-medical-officer-of-health-and-associate-chief-medical-officer-of-health-to-hold-re.html) every Monday and Thursday at 3 p.m. at the Queen's Park media studio.

What are the implications of this? How many teachers will travel over March break and come teach because they are afraid of reprisals? 

Hello,

Stewards, please forward this email to all HWETL members on your email tree.

For several weeks, the Local has been trying to get the HWDSB to suspend their Attendance Management Program (AMP) during the Covid-19 ""pandemic"".  While the board has sent out two memos with advice from Public and the WHO, to remain home from work and self-isolate if you are symptomatic, it has also has the punitive AMP which clearly pressures members to report to work when they are ill.  We felt that these contradictory messages weren't helpful at this time.  Medical professionals have advised the public to remain home if they are symptomatic and not to overtax the medical system with unnecessary visits to doctors (like getting notes for Attendance Management Programs.  The board has so far refused.

However, we do have Collective Agreement Language which states,

L18.03

“The following items are not chargeable to the sick leave plan and shall be without loss of salary:  Quarantine - Any teacher who because of exposure of communicable disease is quarantined or otherwise prevented by Medical Health Authorities from being present for duty.”

 The Local advice is that you follow the advice of your medical practitioner, Public Health, and the WHO.  If you are self-isolating because you are symptomatic, our advice is that you do not feel pressure to return to work.

The Local is working with the board to provide a SFX code for ""Quarantine"".  If it is not available, please use the SFX code for personal illness and inform your HWETL Vice-President that you have done so.  If possible, please try to acquire some sort of documentation showing that your absence is related to Covid-19.  For example, an email from your medical practitioner.  Please don't go to extreme lengths in order to get this documentation such as violating the advice not to visit a Doctor's office, Urgent Care, or Emergency. 

Of course, if you require medical assistance, HWETL would always want you to access that in whatever manner you feel is necessary.

At some point, the HWDSB may close schools, or have their schools closed.  If this happens, our position, based on the above language, would be that teachers would still receive their pay.  However, as this is uncharted territory, we are not able to guarantee that the board would agree. 

In Solidarity,

 Jeff Sorensen

What worries me isn’t the virus but the fact that we have been left in the dark by our universities. All updates have stated that the “risk is low” and nothing else. Many of my friends have traveled to greatly infected areas over our spring break and some show symptoms. They are being turned down by 811 and are told to self isolate at home. But no university student would risk being penalized by missing a class or an exam. No alternative online classes have been provided. Being forced to sit in a classroom full of 700 coughing students is giving me great anxiety. Currently the number of infected people in Quebec remain low. But the numbers reported seem to me far from accurate. I would highly appreciate if anyone could share any knowledge they had on the protocol universities would likely follow.

They said I should put that on the internet or something. So here I am. Steering from the back window!",3/16/2020 4:56,"The best analogy I can come up with to help understand “where we are at” with the COVID-19 crisis on the Earth is this:

Imagine you are riding in a car.   You can not see out the front window of the car.   You can only see out the back window.

Now imagine that car is driving very quickly into a forest fire.

There is a narrow, winding road though the fire, and we’re all on it right now (in the car) but we don’t know which way to turn the car - one bad turn and we’re stuck and in the ditch, burning instead of getting through it.

Everyone in the car has a tiny little hand brake that slows the car by only a few km per hour, a fraction of it’s current speed (FAST!).

The numbers we keep reading about?   The new cases?  Deaths?  Growth rates?...all of that?

That’s what we see out the back window.    

But, where we are now is the front bumper of the car (the present)!

We can’t see out the front windshield, but you know damn well the front bumper is infinitely worse than what you are currently seeing out the back of the car.  

You just know you’d rather be at the back of the car, than the front, right?

Now, each of those “mini-brakes” I mentioned?    

THOSE are YOU social distancing yourself.   Specifically, STAYING THE FUCK HOME!  Traveling and interacting with others only when there is just no other way!

Now collectively, we can all slow the car down, so we can effectively steer (by looking out the back window) through this forest fire called COVID-19.

The slower we go, the quicker we can respond to trends in the road, and surrounding area, or to the spread of the infection, and the treatment of the ill, and very ill.

By not pulling your brake and allowing the car to move quickly, then the more chance we have of crashing the car into the forest fire itself instead of staying on the road and getting through it.

So do your part, pull on your tiny hand-brake as hard as you can and help us slow this car down so we can drive it through this horrific event instead of right into it, okay?

Together.

Yesterday and today the only ones with confirmed travel transmission were from Egypt and USA as far as I can remember yet those two places are not even in the list of “affected areas” listed right below 

Not to mention all these people are in self isolation. 40 people today almost in self isolation. Who is getting their groceries? If some of them aren’t feeling super sick and live alone, who is stopping them from heading to the pharmacy to get some halls or some shit? How could you possibly know if one of these people isn’t a sociopath keen on distributing the virus? We can all pretend everyone has good intentions but other countries have shown this just isn’t the case.

ORIGINAL POST:

Good morning everyone,

I am a psychology student and Teaching Assistant at an Ontario University that closed down yesterday. I have been watching the COVID subreddits for two months now - and have a good idea about how our situation will look in a week or two. 

I feel a responsibility to arrange a coordinated network of people who may be willing to volunteer in some capacity before everyone starts to scramble. We all have special talents and areas of expertise - some of which may be extremely useful during this time. As a recent psychology grad with a specialization in end-of-life decision-making (I did my honours thesis on the withdrawal of TX - specifically about ventilator removal), I understand that there will be extreme trauma to the families whose loved ones will go through this. In the event that this goes very badly for us, I will be offering Zoom meetings to anyone who needs to talk if this happens in their family. I am not a qualified psychologist, and will NOT be purporting to offer specialized support - but I can be a listening ear. 

What is your talent? Do you have special knowledge about something that people may need to talk about? Do you know how to make great meals from canned food and could offer Zoom meetings about this? Do you know how to sew and could offer lessons online? Are you great at a video game and could host an online meeting about it? Are you a teacher and could offer an hour of instruction for kids stuck at home? Are you a nurse and can offer medical advice? Do you speak two or more languages fluently and can act as a go-between for people needing to access resources? Are you willing to go get groceries for immunocompromised or elderly people in your town? Do you have experience or knowledge about resources in your community and could act as a contact point? 

Any random talent or expertise can be used to connect our country-wide community in an effort to make this situation more bearable for all of us. We can also contribute to a sense of normalcy if we arrange community events on an online platform. Keeping busy contributes to maintaining calm and normalcy, which can have a very positive effect on our mental wellbeing. If you have a class you can offer through Zoom (for example - a friend of mine will be offering weight training), send me a quick description of the class and your Zoom ID (it takes less than two minutes to make an account). I will keep a list of the ""classes"" or ""events"" going on, and have a weekly list compiled. When we're all isolated at home, we can still ""attend"" these events, and provide some recreation and structure to our days. 

If you think this is a good idea, and want to add your name and resource to my list so I can refer people - let me know! You can also email the link to this post to reach people beyond Reddit.

Also - if you’re willing to be the contact point for your province or community to arrange and announce online-events, PM me. We can set up a network to coordinate this effort. 

I have made a Google Sheets document for all of the provincial and community point-of-contacts to keep track of the individuals willing to participate. I will share it with you to add your name/update it with your community resource contacts if you are interested.",30,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fihiv3/creating_a_contact_point_for_volunteers_to_help/

Healthcare workers and Indigenous people on reserve will also be prioritized. (This change in the testing protocols is big. Family doctors will not be able to offer or order the test, and people in the emergency room won't be tested either unless they are sick enough to be admitted to hospital.)'

A slow day today for Ontario, with one new positive case and another resolved case. There's no exact information on who the 5th resolved case is but its heartening to see the increase of resolved cases. 

The one positive case today is a man in his 40s who had a travel history of Switzerland, making him the first infected from the Swiss in Ontario. He was presented at St. Joseph's Health Centre and is now in self-isolation. 

The other thing I wanted to discuss is the incredible increase of cases under investigation. The sudden increase of 90 cases under investigation could be a sign for the loosening of testing criteria in Ontario. Another welcoming sign as I always support more testing.

Keeping people calm, spreading out the spread of infection and making sure the essential institutions and the economy of our country remain intact is always going to be a balancing act. 

This means that Canadians need to give serious thought without histrionics into looking out for themselves and by extension their immediate communities. Common sense needs to prevail.

There is also no certainty that Canada is going to rescue you from financial loss due to sick days or go out of their way to bring you home if you travel.

fcdj5p,CanadaCoronavirus,Coronavirus advice from an expert,3/2/2020 23:19,"COVID-19 (coronavirus) advice from an expert:

The author is James Robb a virologist at UC San Diego

Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic

Dear Colleagues,  
as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.

The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.

6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.

7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.

Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! \[LADD's NOTE: there are reports COVID-19 can be spread through the air so avoid areas where people are coughing and sneezing.\] BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. Good luck to all of us!",30,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fcdj5p/coronavirus_advice_from_an_expert/

I’m not a doomer, but I am a realist.  I will under no circumstances subject myself to ventilation or dying in a hospital. As a cancer survivor, having had 11 major surgeries and radiation (since 2012) I not only know I’d likely be denied, but I’ve already experienced horrible, unsympathetic treatment at hospitals.

This is my choice and I’ve put it in writing.

Looks like things are starting to quicken as Ontario has confirmed 17 new positive cases today. As I've talked about yesterday, the high increase of cases under investigation is uncovering the real grasp of how many people are actually infected by COVID-19. As a result of this increase Ontario has suspended public schools for 2 weeks (excluding march break). With the drastic increase of new cases and the potential for more each day, I will be switching to a table format for the information on each cases instead of just writing it out previously. Its essentially just copying the table on the Ontario website right now, but the problem with that one is that they don't show the previous cases, only the new ones. I'll be going back through my previous posts to compile all the info I've previously typed so that the table will have all the cases. 

Some silver lining with the current situation so we're not all doom and gloom, all the current cases we've had are all in self-isolation. This means that none of their conditions are severe enough for hospitalization. Furthermore there has been no additional cases of community transmission, today's cases all had a travel history or were in close contact with a previous positive case. Finally we're now past 4000 cases testing/tested, with the large increases happening during the past few days, showing the expansion of testing capabilities for Ontario.

ffhtwd,CanadaCoronavirus,A draft Open Letter to the Federal Government on COVID-19 (Feedback Welcome),3/9/2020 3:42,"So there's been a lot of developments related to COVID-19 in Canada over the past week. It seems to me that much of the response to the current situation is piecemeal and reactive. I've been doing my best to read up on COVID-19 as well as best practices and pro-active policy options for government to deal with the short and medium term effects. To that end I penned an open letter advocating for policies by the federal government. I'd appreciate any feedback anyone could give on viability and necessity of the policies before I send the letter off or any suggested additions. I would also like to propose that people use the letter as a template to advocate for specific policies from the federal government.

The letter follows:

Hello,

My name is (insert name) and I am writing to you today because I am concerned about the current government response to the COVID-19 virus. I feel that current policies have been largely reactive in nature and that the full resources of government need to be brought quickly to bear. To that end I am advocating for, and encouraging others to advocate for the following policies as part of an open letter. These policies are largely based on the WHO report on COVID-19 as well as best practices and information made available about other countries' responses.

While Canada's current approach to dealing with the virus outbreak has been positive on many fronts, it is becoming clear that endemic transmission of the virus inside Canadian communities is only a matter of when, not if.

To that end, I as citizen of Canada are sending this letter with the following requests. These requests are meant to offer concrete policy proposals to deal with the short and medium term effects from the virus.

**Short Term Policies**

Emergency Declaration

Declare a Canada-wide state of emergency, and use this to begin freeing up resources and coordinating response on a national level. It is quite likely that this virus represents the greatest ability to disrupt the lives of, and kill, Canadians since the last world war. It should be treated as such.

Drive-Thru Testing

In any community where uncontrolled person to person spread is identified offer free drive-thru testing following the South Korean model. This avoids the problem of transmission inside a doctor's office or hospital waiting room and increases surveillance and isolation efforts. While I understand that healthcare delivery is a matter for the provinces a federal funding package for drive-thru testing could be used to ensure their adoption.

Quarantine Legislation

Update and modernize Canada's legislation related to quarantine. Allow designated medical officials to mandate quarantine for an appropriate period with penalties for breaking them. Allowing for forced closures of events and businesses may also be required.

Testing on Entry to Canada

While I recognize that closing Canadian borders is fundamentally impossible, the fact that cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 100 countries mean everyone entering must be screened. Those with active symptoms may be isolated and those who are not showing symptoms must provide a way to be contacted so they can be quarantined if they test positive after being given entry.

Tied Funding for Increasing Intensive Care Beds

Current information from Italy and elsewhere suggests that as many as 1 in 10 patients may need intensive care treatment. A federal funding package for opening new intensive care beds should be presented to provinces. While this may violate certain established legislation devolving healthcare responsibility to the provinces, such legislation may have to be partially suspended during this emergency.

Screening

Empower Health Canada to design screening regimes for businesses and institutions over a certain size. The may include temperature testing for each person twice daily, with an elevated test causing someone to be sent home until cleared by test results.

**Medium Term Policies**

Employment Insurance

Upon a positive test for COVID-19 all Canadians should be able to apply for a fast-tracked month of Employment Insurance. The process should aim to have money to Canadians within 3 days of application at maximum. This will ensure more Canadians can self-isolate without fear of losing work or housing.

Employment Legislation

Amend current legislation to make illegal any termination of workers due to absence caused by COVID-19. Significant penalties may need to apply. Tax benefits for companies that expand sick day coverage to cover COVID-19 quarantine periods may be a reasonable step to increase isolation compliance. Tax incentives for work from home programs and rebates on technology that allows offsite work may also be helpful.

Healthcare Training

As nurses will be among the most important healthcare workers during this period increasing numbers of trained nurses now should be a priority. Federal funding to increase fall classes of nursing students at all Canadian universities by between 30% and 50% should be considered. Increased access to nurse-practitioner training should also be considered. While it will take some time for these effects to be felt increased number of nursing students available after one year and more nurses after two will likely matter to this outbreak. A cursory study of the Spanish influenza outbreak of 1918 shows that secondary outbreaks continued until 1923 or later, meaning that this may be an issue for several years or more depending on various factors.

Drug Supply

COVID-19 is already causing significant effects on global supply chains. And while for some items this may be an inconvenience critical medications are vulnerable to disruption as well. To that end the House of Commons must pass legislation to temporarily suspend drug patents based on recommendations from Health Canada and empower Canadian firms to manufacture generic versions to close supply gaps. Funding for those businesses tied to production capability expansion may also be necessary.

Community Support

With a number of people likely forced to self-isolate in the near future a government department charged with ensuring people in quarantines' well being is needed. A grant program for eligible organizations to meet these needs may be effective however small communities may need to have coordination from a national agency. These agencies should be empowered to do wellness checks, deliver care packages to vulnerable or needy persons. Creating a website linking volunteers to needy persons for doing grocery pickup, medicine pickup or small errands for those in isolation. Think 'Uber' for civic minded volunteers.

Expert Panel

Empower a small panel of experts to examine best practices from around the world and prepare a weekly report and list of recommendations for both parliament and the general public.

Communication

A daily briefing should be made available to all Canadians on current case numbers and projected growth areas as well as the status of current mitigation efforts and best practices and tips. This update should be made available online and play at the top of the hour on CBC radio and Newsnet. A weekly address from the Prime Minister should also be considered.

To conclude, what is needed is the true power of government to come to bear on this problem. Hard choices may have to be made to protect Canadians, but our government has dealt with periods of instability before with swift, decisive and united action and it can again.

Furthermore, I would call on all political parties to present a united front on this issue and pledge to take direction from health experts on all policy matters. Additionally, I call on all opposition parties to avoid any vote of no confidence for a period of 1 year or until new case numbers have been stable for at least 6 months.

Thank you for your time and consideration,",25,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/ffhtwd/a_draft_open_letter_to_the_federal_government_on/
ff3xd7,CanadaCoronavirus,"Low number of ""tests"" completed in Quebec",3/8/2020 7:52,"Is anyone else concerned about the low number of ""tests"" completed in Quebec, as well as the language used in their description of a negative case below? 303 negative ""analyses"" in Quebec as of today, compared to BC with 2008 individuals tested (as of March 6th) and Ontario with 1918 patients approved for testing (as of March 7th).

I am particularly concerned about the language used to describe what is considered a negative case/analysis in their stats. My understanding/interpretation is that this does not mean Quebec has completed 303 tests that came out negative, but that it has 303 negative ‘cases’. Some of which include cases that were decided did not fit the clinical definition of COVID-19. To me this means Quebec has completed less than 303 tests and some cases were assessed and deemed not COVID-19 without even completing a test.

Please share your thoughts. This is just my interpretation.

fjuaq6,CanadaCoronavirus,Legit reasons for implementing a lock down/shut down SOONER rather than later,3/17/2020 6:59,"Other than the obvious of controlling the spread as fast as reasonably possible, a few other thoughts crossed my mind as to why this lock down needs to be done now:

1) Right now people are being diligent in sanitizing, washing hands regularly, being alert, etc.  But if this drags on for weeks and weeks without definitive action, I feel that people will get *'virus fatigue'* and start slipping from their bad habits (not washing their hands as much, letting their guard down a little, etc.) which will make things more WORSE than they need to be.

2) The extreme amount of uncertainty is causing a lot of **stress** for many people - this explains why we're still seeing constant line ups at grocery stores/Costco because people want to stay as 'stocked up' as possible.  Even I was thinking today...should I dig into my 'reserve' or go buy more while I still freely can?  Maybe I'm slightly overthinking it, but it certainly caused me some unnecessary stress thinking about these things today.

fj17gq,CanadaCoronavirus,Rituals of Honor in Hospital Hallways - application to ventilator reallocation during the COVID crisis,3/15/2020 21:19,"We are now beyond the point of determining IF we will need to reallocate ventilators and now understand that it is a question of WHEN.

**While we cannot change this incoming reality, we can shift the experience of those who have to execute it as well as suffer through it.** This includes healthcare practitioners (specifically those who have to make the final call) as well as the patients and their families. The decisions about who gets and keeps the ventilators will begin soon in Canada. We can change the perception of this event from one of complete despair and helplessness to a perception of great sacrifice and honor. **If it is going to happen, we should consider** ***how*** **it happens as our opportunity to have an impact on families as they experience this.**

There is a similar transition that is already a common practice in hospitals. In the case of an accident where an individual suffers a critical injury, their family may be approached to determine if their loved one could donate organs to save another life. In some cases, an “Honour Walk” was facilitated by the healthcare facility ([https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/well/live/rituals-of-honor-in-hospital-hallways.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/well/live/rituals-of-honor-in-hospital-hallways.html)). The family of the individual who had died are led through the corridors following the organ on its way to the recipient. All staff lined the halls in a symbol of respect for the gift being made. This small addition to the process allowed the patient who had died and their families to be acknowledged for their sacrifice. It offered a sense of peace to those families who experienced it. This process empowers patients and their families.

In the case of a ventilator reallocation, and compared to organ donation, an Honour Walk would be easier to implicate. The complications and logistics required to facilitate an Honour Walk for an organ donation are high. This process would be less complicated for the transfer of a ventilator and could become common practice as we now are forced to triage patients and decide who will sacrifice for another.

If we can implement similar strategies of the Honour Walk to the devastating events we are about to encounter, we may be able to shift the perspective of our loss from helplessness to one of empowerment. When a ventilator needs to be taken from one person and taken to another as the priority list shifts, we can honor the individual who is making that gift. We should not forget that that is what it is (voluntary or not) - it is the greatest give we can give - the gift of life. We should ensure that we are honoring the individuals who will be sacrificing their lives for the wellbeing of others.

It is imperative that we contemplate the *way* in which we execute these transitions. These transfers will be devastating, but we should ensure that they are done in a way that acknowledges the sacrifice being made. Perception is reality - we should focus on the perception of the healthcare practitioners, patients, and their families, who will soon be in this position.

Sincerely,

\-A person who has been investigating the decision-making processes at end-of-life (specifically about the withdrawal of treatment through the removal of a ventilator) for the past two years.",26,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fj17gq/rituals_of_honor_in_hospital_hallways_application/

[Graph of positive cases] (https://i.imgur.com/OmTJSEJ.png)

As we reach 42 new positive cases today, we are currently seeing the exponential growth in Ontario right now. Increase in positive cases, increase in testing and increases in cases under investigation. Oh and don't forget the high number of ""pending"" cases in the case information section. Like I've discussed about this yesterday, all of those ""pending"" cases are worthless since they're going to be wiped for tomorrow's cases. This is just a way for Ontario to not reveal that those specific cases are due to community transmission. Looking at the case information today...man that's a lot of ""pending"" cases. 

Another thing I draw your attention to is the increase of hospitalization cases. Today, we've had another patient (Case #125) who is currently hospitalized, a man in his 70s in Simcoe, Muskoka. I missed it the first time around as I was looking through the cases today, it was only why I was putting the case into my table that I realized this man was hospitalized. That makes him the third case in Ontario to be hospitalized (1st being the 1st case and 2nd being the 67th case).

fjn5b3,CanadaCoronavirus,Why isn’t CoVid-19 Pandemic treated seriously and why people should stay united at this time rather than giving in to fear and ignorance?,3/16/2020 23:54,"It’s a known fact now that the Canadian government is not doing enough to protect fellow Canadians while infections rates are skyrocketing. However it should be noted that at the time of writing this post, the infection rate in Ontario did go down compared to yesterday. This does not mean Canada has it under control. What’s happening in Canada is mere luck and lacklustre government planning. This is partially  because a lot is not known about the virus other than its mortality rate and the rate of spread and our government wants our economy to survive when we come out of this pandemic (even at its barebones)

Certain questions remain unanswered as to whether the virus can mutate, why is the rate of infection dynamically different (even after taking utmost precaution) in every country and whether draconian measures should be taken to control the virus. When the virus broke out in China, the country itself had to face a lot of criticisms amid its battle against gaining control of the epidemic. Three months in and China has (relatively) successfully contained the infection but countries that criticized China for not being transparent are being hypocrites by not sharing information to its people. 

Dozens of people leave the airport without being screened and most of these people come from countries where the virus is rapidly spreading. I know couple of folks who did not voluntarily check in to assess themselves leaving Canadians to a higher risk of public transmission. To make matters worse, the protocol to test for CoVid-19 is only implemented at emergencies and test centres. The protocol itself for the most part is exclusive to people who travelled or known to have came in contact with someone who’s positive. People can go get checked if they have it but these centres are here and there completely packed (risking further community transmission). There are efforts in place to assess people at their homes but it’s efficacy is unknown. This creates a lot of paranoia especially during this flu season where everyone experiences similar symptoms but have no idea whether it’s CoVid-19 or the seasonal flu. 

This has led to panic buying and price gouging across the country. Most of the private sector refuses to implement social distancing at their workplace to keep profits churning. To be fair, the government should’ve put in place proper legislations to address this issue so private sectors don’t have to keep their workers (especially front line employees) working to ensure their business doesn’t go bankrupt overnight. Current practices mean, one person who didn’t diagnose starts shopping would wreck havoc across the city. To make matters worse, no legislation exists in Canada to prevent price gouging of essential items especially during harrowing times like this. Everyone from my next door neighbour, local convenient store and corporate giants like Canadian tire are taking advantage of this pandemic and cashing out. This practice overall is just disgusting and shows the worst side of humanity.  

If the infection rate goes down and this virus is contained, I highly doubt it’s exclusive to the competence of our public health system because there are so many holes in the existing protocols for community transmission to go rampant. I highly doubt existing protocols will lead to containment and gradual eradication unless luck played a huge role. What is likely to happen is that the virus will spread rampantly across the country and our governments would be following suit to contain it (like every other country). Why we go above and beyond to protect the giant corporations? Why we cut our interest rate close to zero so private companies can have a breathing room when social distancing and people’s health should be a priority? Why not focus existing funds into an emergency containment plan like China did? These are somethings that drive people nuts because we all watch the news and it doesn’t help us when we see countries going above and beyond to impose containment while in Canada it’s crickets chirping at the CoVid-19 committee. 

As of now, we can only hope our governments strategy in tandem with luck will simply work because if this gradually got worse, we have much more things to worry about other than our already falling apart economy. Stay safe, be cautious and let’s be compassionate to folks around us. We shouldn’t allow panic and ignorance tear apart the basic Canadian attitude.",24,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fjn5b3/why_isnt_covid19_pandemic_treated_seriously_and/

fkhmsk,CanadaCoronavirus,Thoughts from a friend,3/18/2020 9:56,"I’ve got a friend who needed to vent about the current state of affairs but is unable to do so due to the nature of his/her job. Here are their thoughts:

1. First of all, there are a lot of people that are disappointing this society right now. I’m shocked how inconsiderate people are for their friends who have asthma, for their grandmother, and now even pregnant women may potentially have to be isolated. And you can’t stay home and watch movies? I don’t think so. People fought in WARS to save our lives. Just sit down, shut up and stop complaining and be thankful that we are actually behind this thing and know its impact and can (hopefully) make the changes necessary. 

2. Secondly. The current course of action picked by our government is not one to protect our people, but one that is political in nature. Letting US visitors enter our country because you are scared that they might take away resources is compromising the health of your people for a bully. They also know exactly what is happening and how it spreads and how quickly it spreads. We see it in Italy. We are following the exact same patterns and we have a chance to get ahead of this and yet no lockdown has been done. Why??

3. Lastly, to those hoarding supplies for the next year; it will not make you any safer from this virus and in fact will cause the destruction of our society. What do you think is going to happen when people run out of toilet paper or food. You think they are just going to sit there and starve? No they are going to fight for whatever resources we have left and they will do it by any means necessary to survive. Take a little extra than what you need, spread it out and make sure there is enough for others because they will come if they don’t have enough. Everyone is scared right now, everyone is worried for their loved ones. There are simple measures that we can take and learn from other countries, especially considering we are behind the spread. Take these under consideration. Above all, this is something that is either going to make us or break us. We can choose to show kindness and help others and unite in this. Or we can fight for whatever we want and burn to the ground.",22,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fkhmsk/thoughts_from_a_friend/

At a 25% daily compound, we hit that in 19 days. At 30% we hit that in 15 days. I used those numbers because they are more realistic and bracket the trend seen elsewhere. I don't think 40% day over day reflects reality, but rather an increase in testing.

Ottawa's cases doubled. GTA got slammed. More cases outside of thsoe two areas too.

I want everyone to think about what is the end game for this virus?

Let's pretend the following:

\- closed schools, restaurants, public transport, borders, air travel (essentially everything)

\- we flattened the curve, avoided overwhelming the hospitals, disease is on decline

\- now what? we open everything back? the disease comes back...

\- ok cool. back to closing everything, but this time we close everything for extra two month so everyone is guaranteed to be covid19 free.

\- Success, we did it, not a single Canadian has it, we re open everything including the borders, and boom, 1 case get's in, multiplies and we are back to where we started. 

\- does this mean we can't re open the borders with countries who have it? Makes sense doesn't it? 

\- Or is the end game for everyone to get infected in slow and orderly way?

\- what if vaccines don't work, just like with flu, as there are many strains? what's then? 

All in all, I believe all governments have an end game plan? What is Canadian end game plan? China's plan was to contain it. British plan is to let coronavirus run its course? Does it mean Chinese would ban British people for life from entering their country?",19,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fj7kjc/whats_the_end_game_for_canada/
fitdiy,CanadaCoronavirus,"Looking at NBA test results so far, asymptomatic spread is possible",3/15/2020 9:21,"There has been many conflicting and confusing phrasing to the question on whether asymptomatic spread is possible. 

On CBC, Dr. Aylward said patients start to shed the virus right before showing symptom, which can be the day of or the day before, but not much before that.

It just so happens we have publicized tests going on in the NBA with teams that played against the Utah Jazz, after Rudy Gobert was diagnosed with COVID-19. 

Here is the timeline of the games played by Jazz, Gobert played in the March 6, 7 and 9 games.

Mar 6, against Boston - news confirming that an elementary school student who got an autograph from Gobert has been confirmed positive. [source](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/03/13/rhode-island-child-coronavirus-td-garden)

Mar 7, against Detroit - Detroit player, Christian Wood has just been tested positive. He is said to be asymptomatic still, even after testing positive [source](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1238979673520029698?s=19)

Mar 9, against Toronto - all members have tested negative so far

Mar 11, against Oklahoma - first time news came out that Gobert is sick and will not play (he didn't even go to the arena). He was tested some time in the morning and just before the game was set to start, the team doctor stopped the game, telling the referees that he tested positive, around 7pm. His teammate, Donovan Mitchell was tested the same evening and have been confirmed to be positive 

It may be possible that all these are coincidences but it is also likely that Gobert may have been asymptomatic but contagious as early as March 6.

fhixy4,CanadaCoronavirus,How to apply for benefits Trudeau promised yesterday?,3/13/2020 0:22,"My husband and I own a small brick and mortar in a tourist town. The town relies on a lot of Americans and Europeans in the summer months. There's about 50 small businesses just like ours around town and things are starting to look pretty grim here for tourist season.

This week was supposed to mark the beginning of that tourist season but I've already seen a huge drop off in sales since the beginning of March. This is coming after our first down season, which we prepared for and saved up to get us through but now that money is running out. 

Our eggs are not all in one basket, of course, but the other job my husband was to get paid for in April has also suffered delays with the government (through simple bureaucracy at first and now because of the virus)

We also had a family emergency this winter that dipped into our personal savings even more than we expected.

Needless to say this is a perfect storm for us financially. Does anyone know how we can we get ahead of the curve for when shit hits the fan here in Canada and we go on lockdown too? 

I realize this probably makes us sound like we've made bad business decisions, but please understand we are young and only 8 months into our first year as a small business. Our first summer was very successful and we were looking forward to this summer since we could hit the ground running. We planned for a lot of things, including the worst case scenario of zero business over the winter months, but we didn't plan for a pandemic. 
 

Does anyone here know what can we do? I checked the CRA but it doesn't say anything about what Trudeau said yesterday. It even says you have to wait 12 months after registering before you can apply for special assistance EI. When I call them I get disconnected after being on hold for over an hour. I'm at a loss on what to do here.

fjznzs,CanadaCoronavirus,Canadian Tire Price Gouging?,3/17/2020 13:16,"When I was in Vancouver last week, I stopped by the Canadian Tire on Cambie and saw that they had big bins of N95 masks, surgical masks, hand sanitizers, and gloves still available.  I picked some up to send to high risk family in Alberta who haven't been able to find anything for the past few weeks.  I thought the prices were high, but didn't really have time to compare, and it was quite a rush since many people were buying them too.

The N95s were broken up into singles or doubles.  These weren't the single masks with ventilators in plastic clamshells, but appeared repackaged in polybags with store UPC stickers.  

* The cheaper ones were Sperian N1105 Molded Cups, and were available at $7.99 each or a 2-pack for $15.99.  Online, I found a listing for $17.99 for 20 ($0.90/each): [https://www.internationalsafety.com/skus/honeywell-industrial-safety-14110389-saf-t-fit-plus-niosh-molded-cup-disposable-respirator](https://www.internationalsafety.com/skus/honeywell-industrial-safety-14110389-saf-t-fit-plus-niosh-molded-cup-disposable-respirator) .  That's an 888% markup.
* The $8.99 ones were 3M 8200 Industrial Respirators, found here for $23 for a carton of 20, or $21 for a over 10 cartons ($1.15-1.05): [https://www.uline.ca/Product/Detail/S-17009/Disposable-Respirators/3M-8200-N95-Industrial-Respirator%27](https://www.uline.ca/Product/Detail/S-17009/Disposable-Respirators/3M-8200-N95-Industrial-Respirator%27), between 782%-856% markup.
* I bought a box of Condor 50 Surgical facemasks for $34.99 (day before they were marked at $32.99 on sale from $39.99), which I found here for $9.31: [https://www.grainger.ca/en/product/SURGICAL-MASK%2CPK50/p/GGS4KMY1](https://www.grainger.ca/en/product/SURGICAL-MASK%2CPK50/p/GGS4KMY1), almost a 387% markup.

While I do understand the need of perhaps splitting the bigger boxes of 20 masks into smaller quantities so more people can access them, I am quite surprised at the extent they marked everything up.  It's funny that people are calling out individuals for price gouging during a pandemic, and meanwhile a major Canadian retailer is doing the same thing.  I'm not sure if this was happening in all Canadian Tires, but this was my experience in the Cambie location.

* [Critical care capacity in Canada: results of a national cross-sectional study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4426537/)  


>We identified 286 hospitals with 3170 ICU beds and **4982 mechanical  ventilators** for critically ill patients. Twenty-two hospitals had an ICU  that routinely cared for children; 15 had dedicated pediatric ICUs. **Per 100,000 population**, there was substantial variability in provincial  capacity, with a mean of 0.9 hospitals with ICUs (provincial range  0.4-2.8), **10 ICU beds capable of providing mechanical ventilation  (provincial range 6–19)**, and 15 invasive mechanical ventilators  (provincial range 10–24)

&#x200B;

* [Care in Canadian ICUs](https://secure.cihi.ca/free_products/ICU_Report_EN.pdf)

>Most ICU beds are in large or teaching facilities, where having enough ICU beds to meet the growing demand is a widespread challenge. On average, large and teaching hospital ICUs operate at about **90% capacity**, with periods of overcapacity equivalent to between 45 and 51 days in 2013–2014.

&#x200B;

* [Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032)

>A majority of the patients (58.0%) received intravenous antibiotic  therapy, and 35.8% received oseltamivir therapy; oxygen therapy was administered in 41.3% and **mechanical ventilation in 6.1%**; higher  percentages of patients with severe disease received these therapies ([Table 3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032#)).  Mechanical ventilation was initiated in more patients with severe  disease than in those with nonsevere disease (noninvasive ventilation,  32.4% vs. 0%; invasive ventilation, 14.5% vs. 0%). Systemic  glucocorticoids were given to 204 patients (18.6%), with a higher  percentage among those with severe disease than nonsevere disease (44.5%  vs. 13.7%). Of these 204 patients, 33 (16.2%) were admitted to the ICU,  17 (8.3%) underwent invasive ventilation, and 5 (2.5%) died.  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in 5 patients (0.5%)  with severe disease.

&#x200B;

For numerical sake, I will round up and say Canada has a total of 5,000 mechanical ventilators. 

At a 90% capacity or a remaining 10%: **500 ventilation capacity**.   
At 50% capacity : **2,500 ventilation capacity**

fj805f,CanadaCoronavirus,What questions should our reporters be asking during press conferences? I've been frustrated at the lack of literacy behind the questions. Does anybody have contacts to the reporters so we can try to get them up to speed?,3/16/2020 4:32,"Here's the key questions I can think of. I'll keep this list updated. Can you think of any more to add?

..

**Q1: How many recent 'flu' deaths have been tested?**

Our confirmed cases are growing at 20-25% per day. But our deaths seem artificially low. If we aren't testing enough, then that would explain this. Washington and other regions have done retroactive tests on recent deaths and found that the deaths had started earlier than we thought.

..

**Q2: How many tests have been done on non-travel related (community) cases?**

We've done a decent amount of testing. But found few community cases. With 20-25% growth per day, if we have a few community cases, we KNOW we have loads more every day.

And there are reports all over that doctors are not able to get their patients tested who they suspect are infected.

The number of tests can paint a rosier picture if the sample tested is missing the community.

..

**Q3: For every confirmed case, how many are expected to be infected right now?**

The number of infected could very well be 100-1000x the number of confirmed cases.

We are fairly sure the confirmed were infected at least 2 weeks ago. It takes time to catch it, incubate, get the sniffles, get sick, not get better, then seek care, then get tested, then get the results back.

In China they saw a 12-14 day delay between TOTAL lockdown and the slowing of new confirmed cases. that's two weeks between infection and confirmation.

Plus, we know that only 10-20% of cases are severe enough to warrant going to the hospital. In Canada they are telling people with mild symptoms (anything less than trouble breathing) to stay home and ride it out.

So not all of those who were infected 2 weeks ago have sought medical care and testing. The infected is therefore 5-10x higher (assuming all who seek care actually get tested, which is far from certain).

So the number of infected could be 5-10x higher two weeks ago. With a 25% per day growth rate over 14 days, that 5-10x balloons to 115-225x the number of confirmed cases today. Change any of those conservative estimates (of number tested who need it and number of days before testing) and it spikes easily to over 1000x.

..

**Q4: If we lock the entire country down TODAY. How many confirmed cases do we expect to see before the curve starts to flatten? How many infected?**

We saw in china that it took 12-14 days after total lockdown before the exponential growth began to slow (and it dropped very fast).

So if Canada has 315 cases as of mid-day March 15, then even if we LOCK EVERYTHING DOWN RIGHT NOW, we expect to see 7,100 confirmed cases before the curve starts to flatten. 

If there's 100-1000x the number of infected, then that can be 700,000 to 7,000,000 infected. IF we lock it down the instant this post is made.",17,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fj805f/what_questions_should_our_reporters_be_asking/

fdvxtx,CanadaCoronavirus,How would one even go about getting tested for coronavirus in Canada? (Ontario-based),3/5/2020 22:23,"NOTE: I'm based in Ontario, so this perspective is OHIP-centric, but would love to hear perspectives from other parts of Canada as well

This has been a concern of mine for a while. I'm young (under 30) so I'm not so concerned about myself personally, but rather the possibility that I could spread the disease. I'm based in DT Toronto -- my primary care physician moved away to Oakville recently. Even when she was in DT, it took up to a month to schedule a physical with her. I just don't think my clinic is set up for novel coronavirus at all either, like nobody wears PPE, the waiting room is cramped as shit etc. etc. 

My understanding from: 

[https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/laboratory-services/test-information-index/wuhan-novel-coronavirus](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/laboratory-services/test-information-index/wuhan-novel-coronavirus)

is that only people from ""affected areas"" and direct contacts with otherwise positive cases would be tested, otherwise, you need a clinician to see you and agree. But aside from going to an emergency room if symptoms get really bad, my general worry is that it usually takes a month to set up a 15 min visit with a clinic that clearly is not prepared for positive cases...by which time I could have in theory have had the disease, had it peaked etc. etc.

Part of the reason why I'm sharing this is not so much for my personal situation, which I consider low-risk, but trying to get a sense of the aggregate risk. It has concerned me that the GTA has so many imported cases -- now with reports that the clusters in Italy are largely due to the German import German authorities ""thought"" they contain, I wonder about the ""risk is low"", ""people were sent back to self-quarantine"" that typifies public health announcements...

Are there resources/perspective I'm missing that can be clarifying? I'm super curious to hear how other people think about testing for themselves as well.",18,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fdvxtx/how_would_one_even_go_about_getting_tested_for/

fhhnyf,CanadaCoronavirus,"I wrote a letter to our company's CEO & HR urging them to take immediate action on COVID-19. Please consider doing the same, and sending requests to business and community leaders.",3/12/2020 23:01,"Yesterday, I sent a lengthy email detailing my concerns about the spread of COVID-19. I am sharing some of what I wrote in the hopes that others will do the same.

I work for a medium-sized business in downtown Toronto, and (without giving too much away) we constantly have people traveling to and returning from all over the U.S. I have been closely watching how this thing spreads and have been raising flags when appropriate, but was unhappy with the lack of a proactive response.

The news yesterday morning was the tipping point: I gathered all relevant evidence from reputable sources and prepared a formal statement urging our company's leadership to act quickly. I stated that we have to setup all staff working remotely immediately: traveling on the TTC and entering our office building pose risks. Moreover, staff returning from the U.S. recently and going forward will introduce a higher likelihood of spreading it within our company, our building, and in transit around the city.

Of course I felt like a lunatic in the moment - what if I get fired? - but my intuition was right, and about an hour later the news broke that Shopify would be moving to remote operation for all 5,000 employees. Later, the WHO finally declared it a pandemic.

The leadership team told me directly that they would be responding company-wide soon. I hope soon is today and the response is immediate action. Whether or not they adhere to my suggestions, I will share some of my words here in the hopes that others will use it and take action to push their leaders to do the same. (Note: I have removed some paragraphs specific to our company operations)

&#x200B;

>I need to raise concern over this COVID-19 situation. I do not believe our present measures are proactive enough. I have been constantly monitoring statistical data of the spread of this virus, and reading first hand accounts of how it impacts systems and infrastructure as it overwhelms densely populated areas. I am confident in the following.  
>  
>It is certainly spreading around Toronto. There are actions we can take to mitigate risk and reduce exposure to our staff and their immediate friends and family, but they are extreme and require strong leadership and a willingness to enact new policies now.   
>  
>The most powerful action we can take in the benefit of our employees' health and safety is social distancing, coupled with strategies that limit opportunities for contact with individuals who may be infected but not realize it. These are amongst the most disruptive to daily routines, however the only effective solution as seen in China and other countries that have implemented strict quarantine to contain the virus.  
>  
>. . .  
>  
>I am sure I am coming off as extreme, but I cannot stay quiet on this subject in good conscience. The situation in the United States is dire. The spread is already via community transmission and out of control. There is no containment option, a severe lack of testing and healthcare resources, and no plan from their government. This will lead to two likely scenarios:  
>  
>1. Anyone you send to the U.S. will contract the virus at some point.  
>  
>2. Anyone you send to the U.S. is at risk of immediate two week quarantine upon return to Canada.  
>  
>. . .  
>  
>The situation is escalating exponentially, and even though we may not be seeing the impact now, it will soon be overwhelming. This is not theoretical: this is based on what has been documented over the last two months and what has already happened:  
>  
>*excerpts from external sources*  
>  
>Regardless if you choose to implement a policy now or will be forced to implement one in future: this will severely impact our business. The Government of Canada is aware of how bad this situation is and how much worse it will become. They are announcing a fund to help businesses and individuals get through this. There is no excuse to try to delay protective measures for monetary gains. Our staff need to be put first.  
>  
>I urge you to please enact a remote operation policy immediately, and ground all employees in Canada. I urge you to look into other means to support our business through this trying time. Looking at the spread and severity of this virus, it is simply unethical and a health and safety violation to possibly expose our staff and their loved ones to COVID-19.

I shared a number of links and sources, but the best one I found was after the fact, which I forwarded to the CEO directly. If you're going to send anything at all, my suggestion is this:

For anyone reading this and sharing concern over the lack of response and urgency: you are not crazy, you are not alone. Listen to your intuitions, do your research, and prepare. Don't stop trying to educate others, especially older generations who can be more stubborn, or younger generations who can be more selfish and go along with the thinking that 'I'm safe, so no worries'.

We are all in this together, we need everyone to help slow the spread. Please share.",18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fhhnyf/i_wrote_a_letter_to_our_companys_ceo_hr_urging/

I currently work from home  but if she has no source of income this will make things extremely tight.

fby37c,CanadaCoronavirus,"General Information about Coronavirus: What is it, How lethal is it, and What can you do to keep yourself healthy.",3/2/2020 2:19,"**What is it:** COVID-19 is another name for this virus. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the center of the Chinese city. Source: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/what-is-coronavirus-and-what-should-i-do-symptoms#maincontent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/what-is-coronavirus-and-what-should-i-do-symptoms#maincontent)

**Death rate:** According to researchers in the UK, the death rate of coronavirus is less than 2%. Many cases of death related to this disease were actually of elderly people with pre-existing conditions.  Young and generally healthy people have very little risk of dying from coronavirus. Source: [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51674743](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51674743)

**Symptoms:**  Its symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days. For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like pneumonia or bronchitis. Source: [https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus)

**How can you keep yourself healthy:** Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Source: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)

And lastly,

Though Coronavirus definitely poses a threat if a person goes undiagnosed and untreated even after serious symptoms like bronchitis or pneumonia have manifested, proper medical attention at the right time can be very beneficial, and the chances that it would kill you are very low if you don't have a weakened immune system and don't have pre-existing conditions.

But this epidemic is dangerous for other reasons--politicians and the public have been using this disease to spread their own sick ideas. In just a very short period of time, suspicion and hatred against Asian people have increased tenfold, and misinformation is on a steady rise. Please remember to get your information from TRUSTED and UNBIASED sources, and remember to take care of yourself and treat everyone the way you'd want to be treated.

Hope this information can be helpful for someone. Stay safe, everyone!",18,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fby37c/general_information_about_coronavirus_what_is_it/

fix1pe,CanadaCoronavirus,Question about EI in relation to Corona Virus from an airport worker in Ontario.,3/15/2020 14:17,"Hello,

I currently work as a screening officer at an airport in Ontario. I read the article regarding EI but I am not entirely sure how this is going to affect us.

Article: [https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-sick-leave-ei-benefits-coronavirus](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-sick-leave-ei-benefits-coronavirus)

I have very mild symptoms(sore/dry throat, runny nose) and work full time in one of the busiest airports in Canada. We have confirmed cases of Coronavirus that have come through my terminal and the company doesn't really seem to care, some other employees are sick as well and keep coming into work. They say they are cleaning and doing things to make the place more sanitary but all they have done is add some Purell stands for Passengers. Ourselves we use a different hand sanitizer that does not contain any alcohol, meanwhile the government website recommends sanitizer with alcohol: 

[https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html) 

''use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available''

The company has released a statement that is very vague and basically telling us we wont get paid time off unless we meet ""special circumstances"" and say we may be able to move our vacations and use that instead. I cant take time off as I have bills and I do not have any vacation time left. So i was wondering for anyone that has been in contact with anyone that has the virus do you qualify for EI? Our company most likely will not pay us for time off, is this allowed even?

Any help is greatly appreciated as I am scared to be at work touching others and their belongings. There are still a lot of people travelling although it has slowed down a bit. I also have the company statements and pictures if proof is needed.

I was also wondering if we should be going to the media about this as NOTHING is being done to protect ourselves.

A concerned airport worker.

Subject: Confirmation of COVID-19 cases at Lynn Valley Care Centre (long-term care facility)
As you are likely aware, the Provincial Health Officer announced three confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, located at 1070 Lynn Valley Road. This information has understandably increased the concern and anxiety amongst members of our school community. We continue to work closely with Vancouver Coastal Health to keep our community informed about any risk associated with these cases.

Vancouver Coastal Health has confirmed that any care home staff who have potentially been exposed have been identified, instructed to isolate at home and asked to monitor for symptoms. Care home staff without known exposures may continue working and there are no restrictions on the family members of any staff (exposed or unexposed). If staff develop symptoms, they will be tested. If they test positive, they will be isolated along with their family members.

Our efforts to help reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 with increased cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces will continue. We are also considering further measures for the coming week and the weeks following Spring Break.  Most importantly, we ask that you stay home if you or your family are sick.

His response to how Canada is testing, and just discussing the CDC testing - something like ""I can't speak on it, I assume it's very good"" - did not seem well informed, or that he was willing to actually give us information. How exactly do our tests differ from the ones in the United States? We can be grateful though we are testing more frequently and we are in a better position than the United States.

They asked about the ESL school and the possibility of staff contracting the virus by touching door handles, surfaces and other things, and the possibility of communal spread. His response was that ""we haven't seen it yet""... but it has been seen in 4 different continents? Why does he think that communal spread is gonna stop at the borders? Makes zero sense.

To me, he seemed too nonchalant and I am not feeling any reassurance but that is what I expected anyway. What does everyone else think?

Some of my personal takeaways:

* Alberta (and probably BC with updated numbers) are testing very aggressively, which makes sense given number of cases in those provinces.
* The territories have done a surprising amount of testing, although that's maybe easier with smaller population.
* After that, most provinces are testing at fairly comparable rates.
* NL and PEI are a bit bellow average
* NB is way below average, at 1/20th the average testing rate for Canada and with no new tests since yesterday.",14,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fi0pbh/updated_testing_rates_by_province_now_including/

Recently, the WHO [officially](https://mobile.twitter.com/WHO/status/1234872254883909642) declared global mortality for Covid-19 to be 3.4%, saying, ""By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected."" [A recent study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has further shown just how incredibly infectious Covid-19 is.

Unfortunately the spread of the virus has not halted. Thus it is time to arm yourself with knowledge. Unless stated otherwise, all facts are sourced from the [recent WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), which I encourage everyone to read.

You may have to read the following a few times to absorb the information.

#**Psychology**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). 

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) is real and you must therefore be careful who you pay attention to. You will hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to get too concerned about."" These sorts of people have either not been paying attention or could be in denial, a natural reaction to a looming threat. 

* It is better to overreact than to be in denial, as the former gets you prepared while the latter puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial will not take precautions, and they may do things like attend events with large crowds in the middle of an active global outbreak that is showing [no signs of slowing](https://i.imgur.com/GM2gQJQ.png).

* Now is not the time to listen to denial. Now is the time to listen to caution.

#**Critical to know:**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people from of all ages will require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) [source2 ](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of Covid-19, **the danger is not the mortality rate but overwhelming the health infrastructure**, which in turn causes unnecessary death.

* In the USA there are only 2.77 beds for every 1000 people, and 2.58 in Canada. [Check where your country ranks here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds). Why is this important? In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it).

* Because it's still flu season, hospitals are already busy with flu patients. This means it's extra important for the next month or so that we do our part to avoid spreading the new virus.

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for at least another year, if not more.

* Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure).

#**Preventative measures**

* Practice social distancing

* Do not touch your face

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). Carry disinfectant with you.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). Especially stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, touch things in public with your knuckle, do not shake hands, wear latex gloves if you can. 

* Pass along facts to your colleagues and family while avoiding alarmism (feel free to share this post). 

* Consider pressing your boss to work from home. Many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, please consider donating them to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine.

#**Typical symptoms:**

People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days).

Fever (87.9%)

Dry cough (67.7%)

Fatigue (38.1%)

Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)

Shortness of breath (18.6%)

Sore throat (13.9%)

Headache (13.6%)

Joint pain (14.8%)

Chills (11.4%)

Nausea or vomiting (5.0%)

Nasal congestion (4.8%)

Diarrhea (3.7%)

Hemoptysis (0.9%) (coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs)

Conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

[Here is what those symptoms look like on a visual timeline.](https://i.imgur.com/6BSEg6n.jpg)

#**Comorbidities**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. Avery small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%)

#**Mortality rate:**

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0 as of now
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | 3.6%
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | 8.0%
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | 14.8%

#**From WHO report:**

* COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed.. COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences, and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the pangolin ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

**For countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19:**

1. Immediately activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.

2. Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of close contacts.

3. Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in preventing its spread.

4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conducting screening in some patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance systems (e.g. systems for influenza-like-illness and SARS).

5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and simulations for the deployment of even more stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension of large-scale gatherings and the closure of schools and workplaces).

Taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.  During a black swan event, knowledge is power. Arm yourself by [reading the full WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).

This system is ridiculous. I don't care what the numbers tested is they are reporting but its low. By probably thousands, to what they should be testing. We had our first case near our hometown over the weekend too.

Very concerned for family, and for the community. 

This is the third quarantine (2 previous from Wuhan).  We got by the first one... But it's a game of numbers at this point. 

If the government keeps sending everyone to Trenton from cruises, and other countries as evacuees...  eventually, it's going to get out and get into the community.

For the people who actually live here, military families, and regular families that have kids and relatives to be concerned with... this is absolutely outrageous. 

There is a senior's home minutes from the base, public schools, grocery stores, coffee shops...

As is, Toronto is less than 2 hours away, and there is a lot of commuter traffic to the region daily.

I called the local school board, and as of last week, there are no plans at all for taking kids out of school or providing alternate learning options (ie. e-learning from home). Parents cannot wait forever for school boards to make long-drawn-out-decisions. It is too late by then.

* I did find out, that you can keep your child out of school for 15 days (3 weeks), and then you have to sign a Temporary Absence Form (used for medical purposes, vacations, travel, etc... under normal circumstances) which is good for another 4 weeks. So this is good information to know (ask your local school for the details).

Taking one less fear off their plate before their 14 day indoor journey. We plan to continue and I encourage everyone to join in...  even ""if you could do 1 thing"".

Its a truly Canadian Response to a nation in need of a good smile!

Hope this goes without saying .. I know Canadian responses will come with some good one liners.. in fact I encourage it .. just please be respectful to others.

Also ideas should really be within current health authority  recommendations.

I had some ideas to kick it off, some I saw on the news so I won't take all the credit

- Make a call to someone that needs it?
- schedule a video game tournament between friends .. take you and your friends minds off this an hour a day
- Chefs prepping food for those that can't 
- Food Banks ( Ryan Reynolds actually donated a bunch of money today ... would have been more impressive if it was that value in toilet paper. Thanks deadpool!)
- Volunteering (groceries,support etc)
- Supporting our local small business .. we recieved a call about our order being cancelled we offered them half regardless 
- donate of you can, please feel free to share any great places to donate!

fkdtrf,CanadaCoronavirus,Does anyone know what's going on with/for the homeless? What can we do?,3/18/2020 5:49,"Some context: I only migrated to Canada a year ago from a place where you almost never see a homeless person. For some reason I really didn't expect there to be such a large homeless population here but it is what it is. The area we live in Burnaby (BC)  is close to a skytrain & mall and we see at least a dozen different people (a few have even been regulars since I've been living here) hanging around. 

Given the grocery stores are being overrun by people who can actually afford to do so + the fact that most people are now going to mostly stay home, I doubt much will be left for them (both in terms of groceries they might be able to purchase or charitable donations from passersby). They are also most certainly not in the best of health & hygiene so they must be easily susceptible to getting infected.   

I've heard of shelters in other parts of the world being shut down and even if they stay open, the environment will be a breeding ground!

I've not heard much on the news about this topic and to be honest I don't even know what could be systematically done in this case. But since I have nothing else to do anyways, I'm making the biggest batch of Chili that I have a pot for and we'll go hand those out for now.

fhvby1,CanadaCoronavirus,"Advice on what to do with my dad - based in Scarborough, ON",3/13/2020 14:29,"Hey guys,

So my dad works for Environment Canada in Downsview but has to commute 2 hrs with TTC since we live in Scarborough (refuses to drive even though he has a G license because he is afraid of the highway) and apparently he is still going to work tomorrow and all they did was give the employees an email.

I've been asking my dad to talk to his manager cause I am certain shit is going hit the fan in the next week but he then tells me there is a temporary manager and his manager WENT ON VACATION, but he apparently doesn't know where.  I'm freaking out at this point because no one should travel at this point and he's scared to ask or email his manager because he thinks he could get fired, and he has been there for 20 years. I straight up called him a coward because he should ask because not only is he affected, its also other employees and he's the longest exposed to transit. 

I think they will have to anyway due to Trudeau and the school's closing, but this is very irresponsible of Environment Canada and my anger makes me want to call them and curse them out. I live with my parents, and my mom is a 58-year-old Type 2 diabetic. They think I am acting crazy and going overboard, and my mom thinks my meds are making me crazy and addicted (I take SNRI's which are not addicting). Hell, my mom wanted to go to the CN Tower this weekend cause she didn't want her free ticket to expire, I said no.

What should I do? I am considering telling my dad to not touch me or stay in close contact, no hugs or anything and just stay away until he can work from home. Do I quartine myself in my room?

Also, my parents are considering going to my niece's one-year birthday celebration and my aunt and uncle are 70+ with health conditions. I said I am not going but my parents are considering going, I swear i feel like I am talking to two brick walls and wondering if I should barricade myself in the basement.

fjvh5w,CanadaCoronavirus,Proactive Covid-19 Concerns: Don’t Pay at the Door with Tap/Slide Terminals,3/17/2020 8:14,"I was speaking with a friend of mine today who expressed a concern about the preparedness of many pizza and other restaurants that deliver – and the fact that they aren’t paying attention to a possibly significant vector of contamination: portable credit card terminals.

I have to be honest, I habitually have ordered pizza once a week or so for the family and up until now, I have preferred to use my credit card at the door, either via tap or, slide in and press an authorization code. And of course, on top of this is the Next, Tip. Yes/ No and all the press/poke crap that goes along with concluding that transaction at the door.

Until now, my main concern was that I didn’t want to give a small restaurant or even a large chain my credit card number; I was afraid somebody might hack their system and get my CC info.

Yeah well, that was *sooo last month*. That’s no longer my principal concern. Instead, my friend has pointed out that most franchised food systems (and nearly **ALL** Mom and Pop delivery restaurants) don’t bother to wipe down their portable terminals. Indeed, it is difficult to thoroughly do even if they try to be fastidious about it (and to be blunt: they aren't). 

We can easily see how a pizza joint can unwittingly become a vector of infection even though everybody at the business is healthy. Viruses live on flat plastic quite a while. As that terminal is passed to you, that may be your greatest vulnerability in the whole deal. The prior customer may be infected and *VOOM*. The pizza delivery guy has become the vector that so many crew-members became on Cruise Ships – infecting passengers during food delivery. 

The only way out of this is to only order from places using a credit card online or via an app where you don’t have to actually meet or deal with the delivery guy. A host of credit card delivery places/services are set up so that the money is collected ahead of time and applied to your card without any physical meeting at the door required.

Order, let the guy drop it off, pick it up off the ground/floor outside your door without having to exchange money or handle any debit/tap portable terminal.",11,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fjvh5w/proactive_covid19_concerns_dont_pay_at_the_door/

I've been watching this since January and I have been saying since the first night all the video was leaked from Wuhan that this was going to be nasty - unlike what we've seen before in recent history. 

I still don't think i'm wrong. I'm not saying the world is ending - just it isn't the regular flu as much as some of us 10' tall and bulletproof people would like to think. 

Situation: Member of office staff is in a major US theme park for the last 10 days. Arriving back to Canada on Monday. Employer sees no need for that person to stay home. We have 6 other people in the office. Again - I'm not fearful of this ending the world but I do believe we have to be careful where we can. I have elderly family and family going through cancer atm. I would just rather look back at this and know I wasn't the cause of spread. (or at least did my part to try and prevent it)

Do we have any rights to our opinion, given the global circumstance? Boss takes all? The logic is silly to me but I also understand its expensive to keep people away for 2 weeks. I'd like to say something but wondering where any legal ground may stand.

So far I am planning on doing the cooking/laundry and avoiding personal proximity, is there anyone who has experience with this who can offer tips? I’m assuming I should do things like wash my hands when I bring them food or do their laundry/take out their trash. Sanitize the surfaces they touch.

fdxht8,CanadaCoronavirus,Some thoughts on Covid -19 in Canada going forward,3/6/2020 0:11,"I have been following this virus from the getgo, and it definitely seemed to me to be different than prior pandemic potentials. 

I wrote a summary on the last weekend (which is rapidly getting out of date) that basically said we will likely mostly be affected by the slowdown measures that will be implemented, mostly to reduce the health care burden: likely school closures, work from home strategies, restrict travel, etc...  I had initially planned that I may not be working, and my son will likely be at home and to go to my stepmoms in the country... until I realized that I can’t do that, cause she would be higher risk, and I or my son may be an asymptomatic carrier. Ultimately my immediate family are all low risk. The only way we can increase the health care burden is if we are silent carriers and infect a high risk friend/ family member or patient. 

Here’s a thought experiment on a new strategy: it  almost makes more sense for us to get infected early- hear me out here: 
The younger lower risk groups are also mostly the working groups- the likelihood of this virus killing us is low. If we get infected early, we can actively avoid anyone in a high risk category. Then once we are no longer infective, we can go back to work, causing a lower economic impact, while high risk people stay in quarantine and protected until a vaccine is produced. There would also be a degree of herd immunity imparted by the early infected people. most of the economic impact would be reduced, the high risk people would still be protected, and the health care burden would hopefully still be low. 

Problems with the experiment: caregivers, and high risk people having access to both hospitals and food while the virus is glaring through the healthy population... what else?",9,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fdxht8/some_thoughts_on_covid_19_in_canada_going_forward/

They gave me covid test and influenza test. Mind you at this point I was on the mend. Covid came back negative next day, and I believe influenza negative as well. Now let me say this ""bug"" was unlike anything I experienced before. I have never had a 2 week fever in my life. I really only felt lousy and not that bad for a few days, but the tightness and pain in the chest was concerning me. The weakness has lingered still but slowly improving. I did stay inside for the 2 weeks. They checked my lungs with xray and said fine. 

I found the nurse doing the test very gentle and only put the nasal swab in quickly--no turning, swirl, etc. It was quick in and out in like 2 seconds for both influenza and covid swabs.

Data Caps on ISPs are a monetary gate, not a technical one : Most major US ISPs are removing all data Caps on internet usage for the next 60 days

Eviction Culture is a product of greed and not a necessity to keep the rental market healthy : NYC landlords ordered to suspend evictions for 3 months.

The Aviation Industry is apparently more flammable than the Hindenburg : Within days of flight and travel restrictions Airlines that should be healthy are requesting billion pound bailouts or risk closure (Virgin... Of all companies)

The Bar and Pub industry is apparently also the same : Within hours of the advice to avoid pubs Licencing associations are requesting monetary aid

The NHS is woefully understaffed and underfunded : 10 years of cuts are now coming to bite us in the ass

Working from Home is a viable option for many more companies than would like to admit.

Schools are as much daycare as they are education

The Minimum Living Allowance is far below what is actually feasible. Why anyone ever believed that this allowance was sustainable is beyond me.

fioinb,CoronavirusUK,A view on 'herd immunity' from South Korea,3/15/2020 4:02,"I am in shock to be honest, to learn that my own country intends to deliberately allow a large majority of it's 66 million population become infected with the coronavirus. A pandemic that has a death rate of at least 1%, even with the 'flattest' of 'peaks.' 

On tracking the cases to begin with, it seems as though they didn't even try. Now they're officially giving up altogether.

Every other government on the planet, and the World Health Organisation, wants to minimise the spread of the disease, slow it as far as possible. But ours wants everyone to catch it, just on a different time frame to if they just let the virus naturally spread unhindered. 

From an international perspective it seems hugely irresponsible, if other countries successfully get rid of it but the UK deliberately allows it to spread, are you not completely undermining the efforts of the other countries?

I don't want my government to tell me to expect the loss of my loved ones. I want my government to take extensive action against it, like has happened in South Korea. The idea that the British people would be incapable of doing what people have done here to literally save thousands of lives, is defeatist in the extreme. 

What would have happened if rather than trying to contain SARS, MERS, ebola, etc. one country had said ""fuck it, let's just make everyone get it.""

And so many on this sub are just snottily acting as though we special Brits have access to some higher knowledge than literally the rest of the planet.

fhkuwq,CoronavirusUK,Unpopular opinion: outcome of today's COBRA meeting is reasonable,3/13/2020 2:19,"They have introduced two big changes,  May not seem like much, but I think they are.

Firstly, they are removing the requirements for having travelled to certain places for testing, instead basing it on severity of symptoms.  This makes sense as it accepted that community infection is happening.

Secondly, staying at home for anyone with any symptoms, again, this keeps them out of public when most infectious (I know people can be infectious when asymptomatic but it does seem (like most colds, flu) it is most infectious when symptoms are present.

My concern about the ""lockdown"" approaches in other countries, is what happens when everyone comes out again?  The virus won't have just gone away.  Let's say Italy gets it under control, re-opens, and then someone from anywhere else in the world rocks up with the virus and it starts all over again.

Mass quarantine will be psychologically damaging, and it certainly should be limited.  We are culturally very different from China and honestly, I think riots would be more likely in the case of such extreme measures. Many people simply will not do as they are told. 

This is an incredibly difficult situation,  flatten and delay the peak is as good a tactic as any.

Look, I am a life long leftie and do not trust the tories as far as I could spit them (pun intended) but I think the approach is reasonable and balanced.

My GP said to stay at home and rest but couldn't give me any treatment as its viral. And now it feels like viral pneumonia and the pain has spread into my lungs. 
Coughing is dry and agony in my chest. Hot sweats. Temperature was 38/39 2 days ago. Then my lungs started to hurt yesterday and it's gotten progressively worse over the last day, making me call 111. 

I called 111 and then a doctor called me soon after. He said ""go to your GP in the morning and get an Xray"" I said ""the GP say on their website as of 3 days ago, *if you have signs of Coronavirus, or chest infections, cold or flu symptoms please call 111 and do not visit the surgery*""

So I told 111 this and they have said that they're following Public Health England's guidelines and that I don't fit the criteria. So I said ""what about all the community transmissions? My husband works in schools and I work in London"" and she said ""sorry we follow Public Health England"".

fi6ziz,CoronavirusUK,The UK is totally fucked. Get ready. And FUCK BORIS.,3/14/2020 5:15,"So.....

We're not testing suspected cases or contact tracing any more.

We're not taking any of the precautions other countries are.

We're not admitting anyone who isn't ""dangerously unwell"".

We're not even arming GPs and healthcare with PPE.

We're not giving any advice other than ""wash hands"".

This is going to be the biggest fucking clusterfuck of totally EPIC proportions the UK has ever bestowed upon itself.

It's abhorrent and disgusting and Boris, and all his fucking crony Hedge Fund mates and so-called scientific advisers, can get royally fucked. If we could riot in the streets I'd be the first out there with the pitch fork, but sadly that would just make the problem worse.

If you haven't prepared to stay in your house for weeks do so RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Bad bad times are coming very, very soon and when they do, I will be turning off the news because I just won't be able to read it without crying.

I feel VERY sorry for front-line workers who are about to land In. The. Shit. It will be an utter tsunami of cases flooding healthcare in a matter of days. I cannot believe our ""herd immunity"" approach was even dreamed up, let alone rubber stamped. It's criminal. And anyone who thinks otherwise is either a psychopath or just doesn't understand the science behind novel RNA viruses with high infectiousness and mortality rates.

Italy is in lockdown and sees hundreds of deaths a day with exhausted workers triaging. The Netherlands is beyond capacity and not going to admit anyone over 70. Iran is digging mass graves. Countries are shutting their borders. Even the US has admitted the problem and declared a national emergency. Meanwhile we sit here debating the ""science"" behind what could possibly be the worse decision a UK policitian has ever made.

I give up. The world has lost it's fucking mind and we're spearheading it. We had the luxury of seeing ALL of this coming for WEEKS and we've just twisted it and sat on our hands.

fj1p8p,CoronavirusUK,I’m an NHS Community Staff Nurse; here’s my personal experience of how corona virus is being handled in my workplace... and it’s concerning,3/15/2020 21:59,"Hi. I’m an NHS Community Staff Nurse (CSN) in the East Anglian region of England. This post is designed to explain to members of the public my personal experience of my employer’s response to the corona virus outbreak from a front-line perspective. For context, my job is to treat people in their own homes and care homes who need medical treatment who are too frail or sick to attend a doctors surgery. We most commonly treat people with complex wound care problems, those who are dying and who desire palliative care in their own homes, and long-term diabetes management. As you can imagine we overwhelming see the most vulnerable of the elderly and disabled; those most at risk of contracting corona virus.
With that in mind let us begin.

I recently returned from a major tourist destination in Europe after a few days holiday with a friend; to note it was a major city with one of the worlds busiest airports but not a destination on the list of the most affected. Shortly after returning to England I began to become ill, so I rang 111 (NHS helpline) as advised by the government for information on what I should do. My symptoms were demonstrative of possible corona virus (hacking cough, fever, flu-like symptoms) and my concern was that due to my job role and daily exposure to the most vulnerable in society that they may want to test me or ask me to quarantine. Despite my role I was told that even though I had symptoms of the virus because my holiday destination was not on the list of majorly affected countries I should return to work. To note there have been confirmed cases in the country I visited. I informed my manager and proceeded to receive a number of phone calls from management asking me about my illness; it was quite clear to me that they were determined for it not to be corona virus from the outset despite having no evidence to prove as much. I have no evidence of this, but that is the impression I received from their tone. After a few more days off where I genuinely felt too ill to return to work and out of concern for my patients well-being I went back to work and have been practicing safe hand hygiene to the best of my ability as I would do normally in an attempt to prevent the spread of whatever it is I’ve got. On returning to work I discover that we (the district nursing team) have not been sent hand sanitisers in this weeks stock delivery; the time when it is most needed. On top of this we the regular community nursing staff have been issued no additional guidance on the virus and on anything we can do to help prevent it’s spread. I feel that not enough is being done to protect our most vulnerable patients at all quite frankly and I am fearful for what might happen. Fortunately care homes have been proactive in closing their doors to our service in order to try to prevent the spread of the virus from the outside into buildings full of the most vulnerable, but I feel that our NHS Trust and the government at large has not thought through just how vital our service is to the elderly and disabled, nor how we should probably receive individualised training on the virus and receive routine testing for it. We have multiple members of staff off sick, and yet to my knowledge none of them have been tested despite our job role and exposure to the vulnerable because we do not fit into the governments narrow criteria for testing and quarantine.

I’m worried that this might be a disaster waiting to happen. I sincerely hope I’m wrong.

TLDR; NHS community nurses who show flu-like symptoms are not being routinely tested for corona virus or being asked to quarantine despite their regularly proximity to the most elderly and disabled.",164,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fj1p8p/im_an_nhs_community_staff_nurse_heres_my_personal/

For some reason the vast majority are subservient subjects to these lies which I cannot understand. There is continuous repetition about immunity. There is rampant censorship all over British centric sites on this subject.

It's a lie. It's all a lie. It's like telling your people to run out and catch HIV on purpose in order to build an immunity to it. It's not going to work like that, case after case shows that reinfection happens. For all we know, this remains dormant like TB.vThis virus can cross the blood brain barrier. There is a high chance that we have not a clue how bad off people will be in a year's time since this virus has only been around for a few months. The healthy young could survive but also be wheelchair bound after time passes or face organ failure. 

There are ways around the economy issue. People can be quarantined. Only students from designated parents of essential services need to go to school in order reduce gatherings. Mortgages and rents could be suspended, which is the case now in Italy. Eviction and bailiff rights could be removed for the time being.

It is not a binary choice of economy Vs mass death. It's a lie. The banks could be told to back off. And let's face it, the economy is fucked no matter what at this point. Mass death will only make it worse. Social services will be even worse off when both parents are in hospital since a high percentage will be critical, as can be seen in Italy.

Lastly making sure everyone catches it now, will destroy the NHS. It will maximise deaths because the British will be without a healthcare system for a longer period of time.

This will pass on asymptomatically. I think anyone with an appropriate adjustment reaction time can see the writing on the wall.

ffabok,CoronavirusUK,Must read - Testimony from surgeon working at heart of Italian epicentre,3/8/2020 17:29,"Source at bottom. This is a long read, but please take the time. The message is very important and gracefully written. It applies to all of us, even here in the UK.

Translation via /r/medicine (NP-linked, please do not participate if you are a non-medical professional):

«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on ""how to be responsible on social media"", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what's happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.

Still, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of ""chilling"" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).

I still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.

The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.

Because that's the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it's not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.

I can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have ""temporarily"" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.

The cases multiply, up to a rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I'm already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?"" or ""leave that admission to me, i will take care of it."" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.

Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I'm happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.

Tell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don't spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.»

fi45vl,CoronavirusUK,"I'm Italian, I've been living in London for several years and my family is lockdown in Milan. Please, UK and rest of the world, wake the fuck up.",3/14/2020 2:20," This is not just the flu. It'a serious virus that will probably determine the next decade.

I live in London right now and what it' being done is not enough. I daresay it's barely anything. Yes I heard the announcement of the Prime Minister Johnson yesterday, and what he said is true. Many more people will lose their loved ones and there are not just 800 cases in the UK. There are many, many more. We need to stop treating this as a normal flu and start accepting what is happening and respecting it. I look out of the window and all I see is people living their normal lives, going around with no masks and being sardines in an ultra crowded tube. That's is going against common sense in a basic level.

The UK, Germany, France, Spain, USA are all following the exact same trend as that of Italy. They are just a few weeks behind. [This](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*cuFMe4mtNXF--Iz7VS7FpA.jpeg) was posted on the 9th of March, so 4 days ago. That means that in about 9 days London will be in the same situation as Milan, and I guarantee you It's not a good situation.

My parents are locked at home right now. No-one can get out unless they have a valid reason. They literally have to have a [paper with them](https://media2-col.corriereobjects.it/pdf/2020/interni/indicazioni-coronavirus.pdf) every time they leave the house and that paper states where they are going, the reason why and where they left the house from. It's serious.

Shopping malls, cinemas, theatres, bars, pubs, restaurants and fucking McDonalds are all closed. Shut down. This evolved from a situation where they were still open and the people working there would go around telling people to stand at least 1 meters from each other.

People are working from home. The Italian government is drafting now the [new temporary economic decree.](https://www.lastampa.it/economia/2020/03/10/news/decreto-economico-anti-coronavirus-ecco-le-linee-guida-1.38574804) Suspensions with guaranteed reduced salary to workers unable to go to work and mortgages blocked. This will help citizens unable to have a salary to have a source of income in the coming months and not be crippled by house mortgages.

The ""message to the nation"" from Boris Johnson and President Trump were both too fucking late. Conte's statement in front of the cameras was a week ago. [It's here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9aj23ZNliY&t=4s)

[For the love of god governments, START TESTING.](https://imgur.com/a/eArzXrN)

The Italian Government has always had a problem with being trusted by the people. Italian love to complain constantly about politicians, and for the most part, are even right. I don't feel like getting into this, because I have been away for a long time. I can tell you though that my parents, who haven't supported a government for 15 years at least, are saying that they are doing everything they can, right now. Trying to handle an impossible situation and try to make the best they can, with what they have.

I think when all of this is over and they get out of this, Conte will be remembered as one of the best President that dealt with a crisis like this, exceptionally professional and with the right amount of transparency. I couldn't be more proud of my home country and to be honest I'd feel a lot more fare if i was there during this crisis.

Italy just received help and aid from China, a month after china received help from Italy. In these times, we need to help each other.

We need to take a hard look at the situation and stop pretending it doesn't exist. It's coming. **Italy is ahead of the curve, but it's no outliner.**

[Please read this from u/goddessofthebitches](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fhxap2/from_an_italian_to_the_rest_of_the_world_you_have/), it explains perfectly where we are headed, here in the UK and in the rest of the world.

>**So that's what the situation is like now today as of the 12/03. Keep in mind that it all happened in around 2 weeks, 5 DAYS FROM STAGE 3 TO NOW.**

**I'm fucking angry.**

I'm angry because I'm a university student and part-time worker. I'm angry because this morning I had an argument with my manager and while I was presenting him with all the proofs of the fact that we should close the store, at least temporarily he said, and I quote word for word.

>ME; ""We should close the store, its going to be bad in a few week""  
HIM: ""Tell me more whats coming? peak of the virus? are we all gonna become zombies?""

FOR FUCKS SAKE. This is not a joke. Italy was where we are right now about a week ago. We should not be in contact with customers that sneeze and cough right wherever they want. It is not necessary. It' dangerous and there is a fucking epidemic outside. You are an ignorant fuck because you are making fun of me while my family is in lockdown and I don't know when I am going to see them. IF THE UK GOVERNMENT started implementing some active and aggressive measures China and Italy and South Korea style, maybe, maybe we would have a chance to contain this fucker. **BUT NOOO.**

I'm angry because every single day I don't attend class, even though I can watch the recording online later, it gets classified as an absence.

In many European countries are closing schools. In Italy, schools have been closed for weeks now. maybe about a month. Why the fuck couldn't we act earlier on this?

fixngj,CoronavirusUK,Government Plan Timeline,3/15/2020 15:21,"I know a lot of people are worried about the government taking no action over coronavirus but equally a lot of people seem to have missed last week's press conference, which outlined when certain measures will happen. 

The action being taken now:

All care homes have stopped visitor access (advice from Public Health England but not part of official strategy to allow flexibility).

Hospitals are only allowing low risk visitors (same as above).

Self isolation for 7 days for anyone with a cough or cold.

NHS, government and military emergency plans activated.

Emergency legislation drafted.

Testing capacity increased from 2,000 to 10,000 a day, change in testing criteria.

Start of gene sequencing to track number of cases and spread.

Next week:

Emergency legislation comes into force.

End of mass gatherings.

Anyone who has a cold self isolate but also the entire family.

Next week to 3 weeks depending on number of cases

All over 70s and people with high risk medical conditons to self isolate for 14 weeks.

Schools shut until September.

Military mobilised to help support the NHS, public order and food supplies. 

Have I missed anything? I'm shit at Reddit and on my phone so can't link YouTube, but the press conference is there for us all to watch. 

My parent friends were shocked and didn't believe me when I said schools will be shut for as long as they will be. People are getting upset at not being able to see their relatives in homes and don't realise it will be for 20 weeks. 

Keep in mind, people in Wuhan have only been isolated for 7 weeks. What the government has planned for us will last another 7 weeks if we were them.

This sub is becoming a place where people come to complain or share opinion. That's fine and we're all going to need it over the next few months! Could we also look at providing information that people need to understand what we are going to face in coming weeks? . 

We are at a stage where we don't need to make a drama out of a crisis. People have already died and many more are sick. People this weekend are coming to terms with possibly never seeing their relative in a care home again, in most cases without having a chance to say goodbye. People with relatives abroad in hotspots are very worried. My Italian friend couldn't have a funeral for her dad this week.

Things are getting real for a lot of people and it's only going to get worse.

Personally, I'm on the fence about whether this plan will work but there is a plan and it's really quite draconian once we start it.",111,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fixngj/government_plan_timeline/
fho2fw,CoronavirusUK,Possible reason for the UK’s lack of action,3/13/2020 5:33,"If you look at previous pandemics such as Spanish Flu in 1918 then there is a clear trend that if vigorous measures are brought in too early herd immunity isn’t reached due to not enough people being infected and recovering.
This leads to a second wave of disease once everyone relaxes and the disease is established endemically. In 1918 this second wave killed a far larger number of people. 

In European countries where they are closing public spaces and schools and stopping large crowds they will have to maintain this for a few months until we reach summer and the infection numbers hopefully wane. Then when autumn comes cases will rise again and more people will get infected as globally there will be more sources of infection potentially leading to a more severe and rapid outbreak and the same measures having to be put in place. 

Meanwhile in the UK if the first wave is allowed to grow big enough the second load of cases will hopefully be smaller due to reduced transmission and infection numbers due to herd immunity. Looking at it from the perspective that most people will get it eventually the number of elderly exposed is decreased and the number of deaths is hopefully reduced as we won’t get this second ‘wave’ as badly. 

I think the idea is the sooner we get over the worst of it the sooner we can recover and be better protected against a second flair up which is a very rational albeit slightly cold approach as it overall protects the population better reducing total deaths

What this obviously depends on is whether or not you believe our healthcare system is up to it which is another question. Obviously the government thinks it is or think they can make it that way and also believe they can get this balance right in letting it grow big enough and slowing it at the right point.

The way the UK government is handling this is atrocious. More people will die and we’re constantly putting more people at risk by not taking better containment measures now. And the reason why we’re not taking them now? David Halpern, proponent of nudge theory and the rest of the UK government who diligently listen to him and their government funded think tank. 

As much as my words here are venomous, I haven’t told any mistruths yet. 

David Halpern is a psychologist, not a medical doctor. The government is constantly claiming to be referring back to “the science”, and that science being psychology. Great for mental health! Not great for a fucking virus. They have ignored epidemiologists (editor in chief of lancet journal Richard Horton) who say that more aggressive measures need to be taken NOW. Their response to this? Wash your hands for 20 seconds. 

Google nudge theory, it’s a behavioural science theory focusing on positive reinforcement. This is the science our government are consulting. They are drumming it into us to wash our hands for 20 seconds because their govt funded psychologists have overridden the advice from epidemiologists.

ffyanv,CoronavirusUK,Not caring about the deaths of old people is a “Moral Decay” - Dr Tedros @WHO Conference today,3/10/2020 1:30,"Dr Tedros’ statement at the WHO today feels quite scathing against those that are disregarding the seriousness of the virus because it only kills old people.

I wonder if he’s directing this at (amongst others) our government, as BoJo’s inaction is arguably due to a thought process that the economy is more important than the lives of the old, sick, and vulnerable.

>	I think this particular issue, especially about our senior citizens, or the elderly, is very very important. If anything is going to hurt the world, it’s a moral decay. And, not taking the deaths of the senior citizens as a serious issue is one of the moral decays.

>	Any individual, whatever age, any human being matters. And, it pains us to see, actually, some places when they want to move in to mitigation because the virus kills seniors or older people only. That’s dangerous. Whether it kills a young person or an old person, or a senior citizen, any country has an obligation to save that person.

>	So, that’s why we’re saying “No white flag, we don’t give up. We fight to protect our children, to protect our senior citizens”. At the end of the day it’s a human life. We can not say that we care about millions when we don’t care about an individual person who may be senior or junior, who may be young or old, that’s what WHO is saying.

>	And for all countries, a comprehensive approach, a blended approach. An approach that can help contain this outbreak is very important because the death rate from this outbreak is high. We shouldn’t categorise it by young or senior. Of course, to understand the epidemiology it is fine to do that, but for action I think every life matters. Every individual life matters. If we don’t care about one individual, whether it’s old or young, then we’re not serious. And that’s why we’re saying this is a moral decay if we try to categorise it that way. A moral decay of the society. Thank you.

fdkvhj,CoronavirusUK,We are in the great minority,3/5/2020 6:18,"The minority of people in the UK that actually care about this and understand the risks.

This group of 2,300 users compares to a Reddit population (of UK users) of about 7 million. A tiny percentage of UK users of Reddit have found this sub. Yet this sub was very easy to find for all us who are interested in this issue.

Frankly, I see people coughing, touching their faces, not changing their habits; even a colleague of mine -- whose partner has a weakened immune system -- fully understands the risks of this, yet I still see him literally lick his finger when turning pages (a pretty gross but common habit, especially for older people).

Personally I think this will (continue to) spread like wildfire. Our population is far too complacent, and our population density is high (especially in cities, naturally).

The UK will be the next Italy or Iran. The masses will start caring once it's too late. People don't seem to understand exponential growth or even compound interest.

fk88c0,CoronavirusUK,Ten-yard stares in the tinned tuna aisles,3/18/2020 0:31,"I can understand the stockpiling mentality, in a way.

It’s the desire, no, the *imperative* to take action following growing panic. There is an invisible enemy all around us. Fight or flight is kicking in. But we can’t fight something we can’t see, so the logical human instinct is to do something to prepare. Getting food and supplies is a pragmatic action which lifts us, if only temporarily, out of helplessness.

Things have become “weird” very quickly. Normal life has been flipped on its head in a short space of time, a G-force catapult into a different way of being, so our bodies are still back on the ground but our minds are hurtling through this unknown trying to process it all.

If anyone had said to us six months ago that a highly contagious new virus would sweep the globe, with the potential to kill those nearest and dearest to us in unknown quantities, and that it would affect every single person and every area of life, and would cripple the economy and livelihoods, and even change life as we know it, that person would be laughed out of the room.

But now, we’re suddenly at the beginning of one of those zombie films. It feels like we’re living in a horror film, except the scary part hasn’t happened yet.

It is safe to say that we are officially in uncharted territory. All bets are off.

Therefore, the stockpiler’s mentality goes, who’s to determine that there won’t be a run on the banks, that the Government won’t refuse to support us, that the supermarkets won’t run dry, that society and civil obedience won’t collapse, that there won’t suddenly be a period of literal need for survival? Therefore, the stockpiler says, who’s to say that I won’t need that extra tin of tuna or that extra roll of toilet paper? And if the world really is going to hell in a handcart, shouldn’t I be free to wipe my arse in exactly the manner of my choosing?

It’s my first week of working from home, and considering the Government’s latest guidance that if anyone in a household gets sick they must all quarantine for 14 days, I decide to buy a fortnight’s worth of goods.

Approaching the supermarkets, I steel myself for what might lie ahead. I feel as if I’m entering a battle.

I’m at a Tesco superstore first, and pleasantly surprised at the lack of mass hysteria. I’m able to cross off most of my list. But the stockpiling is evident: A lone egg remains on the egg shelves. There are no packets of pasta, frozen vegetables or cold and flu medicines, and certainly no toilet paper. All of the lager packs are gone, and all of the Gordon’s gin, and the white wine of choice appears to be Sauvignon Blanc. Noting that the washing tablets are almost gone, I take one for my basket. Herd mentality is alive and well, it seems. There is a strange expression on everyone’s faces.

“Are customers being nice to you?”, I ask one of the supermarket workers.“It’s not so bad for us, but at the tills it’s worse because we have a two-item max policy, and people don’t like it when they’re told that”, she replies.I ask the same question to the woman at the checkout.“No comment”, she says wryly.

When I arrive at Sainsbury’s I’m relieved I had the Tesco shop first for context. Entire shelves have been stripped bare and whole rows of vegetable boxes are upturned and empty. Considering it’s 11am on a Tuesday, this is startling to me. The atmosphere is febrile. The tinned aisles are manic. There are three boxes of tinned tomatoes left; I take one. I ask a kind store worker if there’s any tomato puree, and he fishes out the last remaining one, telling me: “It’s your lucky day”.

No eggs, no toilet roll. Some people are picking up double packets of kitchen roll. Out of curiosity I check the booze aisles: Smirnoff’s vodka is a popular tipple, and most of the lagers are gone. (Perhaps superstitiously, Corona remains on the shelves). A group of lads roll through, laughing at the situation. “Veggies are last on my priority list!”, says one as they march past what would have been the spinach shelves. Another one Facetimes the empty shelves for his mate. But on the rest of the shoppers: that expression.

I’m queuing to pay.“Is there any loo roll?”, the girl in front of me asks the checkout worker. She’s told to take the one in the trolley, and it’s only then that I notice two full-to-the-brim supermarket trolleys next to the checkout till. At the end of the lane against the wall are eight similarly crammed shopping trolleys, haphazardly grouped together, seemingly abandoned.“What’s up with those trolleys?”, asks the girl.“It’s people who’ve put so much in their trolley and then they’ve got to the counter and they either can’t afford it all, or they’ve forgotten their wallet”, says the woman at the checkout.“I don’t get that”, says the girl. “Like, how can you misjudge that much how little you can afford? How does it get to the point where your trolley is that full and you have no idea if you are going to buy it?”I concur. She smiles when she leaves: “Good luck”.

Waitrose is my final stop. It’s sombre. Those who meet each other’s eyes quickly look away. By now I’m doing an anecdotal class-based analysis of what people are stockpiling. These healthy upper-middle class types have stockpiled almost all of the fresh vegetables. I came for ginger, but it’s gone. I also came to get the eggs and toilet roll, but I already knew by the time I came across the empty shelves that there would be none left. I leave almost empty handed, save for a conciliatory impulse-buy of a pretty little chilly pepper tree.

There’s no small-talk between strangers in the shops about Coronavirus. It’s past the point of trite pleasantries and droll irony. We can mention things in its periphery, like, gosh, isn’t there such a queue for a trolley, and, aren’t people silly for wanting so much toilet paper! But the word itself is now a contamination.

All the way around the shops, I’m trying to pin down just what that expression is that I can see in everyone’s eyes, that same look they all have. Do they feel the same as me, that I’m in a slow-motion, underwater car crash and there’s nothing I can do to get out of the car? “Fear in their eyes” - that’s such a cliche. How on earth do I know whether they’re feeling fear, or resilience, or despair, or hope? But by the time I got home, what I realised was this: No matter what their emotions were, every single person in every single shop was thinking about the coronavirus. Unequivocally, I knew that’s what they were thinking, and right back at me they knew the same of me.

Thousand-yard stares in the tinned tuna aisles. How did it come to this so quickly?

I have seen a few people wearing masks, however the reaction that some people have towards it is really annoying me. Don't look at them, don't laugh, don't make eyes with others with a stupid smirk as if ""oh look at this fool,"" people are protecting themselves.

I spoke with someone last week who had told me he had openly asked someone why he was wearing a mask and said he found the whole thing ridiculous. How rude?!

I am sick of this. People need to start wearing masks! I will be wearing my mask whenever I leave the house and I am prepping myself for the reaction I know I will get. 

Now is not the time to 'conform' and be afraid of standing out. Do whatever you have to protect yourself, your children and families.  Hopefully more people will begin to follow.

fk5gfo,CoronavirusUK,"Too little, too late. A government that will be remembered for careless inaction.",3/17/2020 21:42,"With the latest rumours from hospital staff that our infection numbers are up to 5 days out of date, paired with the fact that the incubation period is up to 14 days, it is safe to say that a large amount of the population has covid-19 already and many will not be showing symptoms until a week from now.

Considering this, there is the possibility that the government have been acting on out-of-date numbers - they are required to be thinking at least two weeks ahead due to these factors. We will not even see the effects of the new advice given yesterday until a week or more from now, despite currently entering a 'high inflexion phase' of cases doubling every 3-5 days with our out-of-date numbers. We are at the point where the deaths are the only reliable indication of the current situation and once our NHS is overloaded, which it's beginning to, it will rise even further.

\- Why are other European countries, such as Germany, ahead of us in trying to 'suppress' the disease instead of 'mitigating' it? (in the words of the damning report that has changed government strategy:  [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) )  
\- Why haven't schools been closed and public gatherings banned despite strong advice to minimise social contact? It feels contradictory to use such strong language and not use the law to back it up. Many people simply aren't taking it seriously because everything is still open and running as usual.

Even if home isolation were to be enforced, the disease can still spread to those in your household. We need to learn from Italy and act sooner rather than later. It appears that this Government cares more about the economic impact of extreme measures rather than the preventable deaths that will happen due to a lack of ventilators or ICU beds. They have chosen the science that rationalises their laissez-faire approach and are beginning to realise their error in the face of scrutiny:  [http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/\~vnicosia/UK\_scientists\_statement\_on\_coronavirus\_measures.pdf](http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~vnicosia/UK_scientists_statement_on_coronavirus_measures.pdf) .

It is starting to feel like too little, too late after years of underfunding the NHS and scaring away our European nurse workforce with brexit. Quite frankly, this government is to blame - to use their language - 'for not fixing the roof while the sun was shining'... and not closing the windows, or the doors...and now we are all sodden and feeling something coming on. Let's hope it's just a cold.

fieis5,CoronavirusUK,"As a teacher, is there even any point in trying to avoid the coronavirus anymore? (Teacher rant)",3/14/2020 15:01,"Government plan seems to be not closing the schools so that the economy, grandparents, and health are workers with children don't suffer. Plan is fair enough, but it places teachers basically as sacrificial pawns for the greater good.

I take public transport to work where I am surrounded by kids coughing and sneezing on each other as a joke, and at school as another poster mentioned the kids are even more wild than usual. 

With government talks to relax classroom sizes, and they're plan making no mention of teachers when they go on about schools being full of the young who will fair well, it is clear they expect and don't care about our health. I'm young so I'm not fazed in terms of my personal safety, but all the most elderly, and therefore most experienced teachers, are effectively being put at risk and subsequently ignored. 

Public also doesn't seem to care, but that's nothing new. We are just glorified babysitters in this country, being told by parents how crap and ungrateful we are all the time. Even now when we've been placed in a role where we need to control thousands of walking germ factories for the greater good we've got comments on Facebook from parents complaining about staff daring to self isolate or complaints that we 'better work in the holidays to fix this' because us barely being able to teach with half of the staff being in the plague pit is our fault. 

Are we equivalent to health care workers on the front line? Hell no, and nowhere near as heroic.

However we continue to work in the most dangerous of places for infection whilst in other countries schools are shut, and rather than even hearing just an ounce of 'thanks for staying open' we are just ignored by the media and belittled by parents.

Not all of course, or even most I wager, but I've heard a lot more voices of complaint than I have even a simple hello. 

This whole set of events has just made me sure about my decision to leave to another country. Better pay, better working conditions, and better treatment and respect across the board? Sign me up!

To all those on everywhere who criticise teachers at every chance they get with the message 'If you don't like it, leave it', congrats you have won.

Me and thousands of others will continue to leave, taking our knowledge and skill sets with us. I'm not expecting a pot of gold for my efforts, but I'm sick of parents belittling my colleagues who work themselves to death for their children, and this whole crisis has just exacerbated that feeling. 

To those who remain - god bless you. I couldn't hack the constant abuse, but I genuinely thank you for staying as easily 70-90% of parents and pupils do care. It's just a shame the other percentage are so loud, and schools do nothing to help it.

Edit:

Thanks to all those with the kind words of support. I've calmed down a bit now, just woke up this morning to some nasty messages about a colleague who has went home sick and I felt the need to vent. (likewise excuse the spelling mistakes, typed in a hurry). 

Also again please knock it off with 'x has it worse so don't complain'. Just because my neighbours house is completely on fire doesn't mean I can't complain about the fire starting in my living room. (Plus, unless I missed it, nobody is insulting health care workers unless they are complete idiots.

fesac5,CoronavirusUK,What I learned from Swine Flu,3/7/2020 16:12,"I had swine flu ten years ago when I was 35. Very similar to this at the start so when we had pupils return from Mexico nobody was worried until myself and another teacher ended up in hospital. It took about a week from feeling ill to being unable to breathe.
Food - I couldn't swallow anything with any lumps at all so lived on soup, cold as I couldn't manage to get to the kitchen. If you live alone worth moving your microwave/kettle to your bedroom.
Sleep - Bed became a sweaty mosh pit from hell. Get a couple of sets of 100% cotton bed sets to change and a stack of clean towels so if you're too exhausted to change sheets you can lie on a dry towel at least. Open your window even if you are feeling hot and cold or your room will be even more of a rank cess pit.
Key - leave a key with a neighbour or in a hidden place in case you can't get to the front door.
Medication - paracetamol, water and a sleeping aid. Benedryl at least gave me a couple of hours of shut eye.
Finally, don't expect to bounce back. I developed terrible fatigue and went back to work far too soon.
God speed all. Hope this helps a smidge. Edit: I know this isn't flu, just tips if you find yourself writhing in a swamp of your own bodily fluids. Edit two: that wasn't meant to sound pervy.",77,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fesac5/what_i_learned_from_swine_flu/

fflg67,CoronavirusUK,First to wear mask at work,3/9/2020 7:41,So you might remember from my rant that I have a compromised immune system. Today I wore a mask at work after getting permission from my boss. It had very mixed reaction from both people I work with and customers. I work retail at a busy petrol station. My boss was fully supportive and was surprised Iv not worn one earlier. Quite a few customers seemed really happy that I was wearing one. Declaring that if they could get one or had one they would be wearing it. Only a couple of people seemed a bit shocked by it. One refused to let me touch any of their items for fear that I actually had covid19. Over all it was a really positive response. Of course Iv spent most of the day informing people that it’s because I have a compromised immune system as per my boss’s request should anyone inquire or act rude about it. I only have a very limited supply and they are disposable. One customer even tried to offer me a lot of money if I happened to have an extra one. Everyone who has asked me where I got it from Iv told them I just got lucky. This is a small area and people talk so don’t want it getting round that my family are preppers and that’s how I happen to have one. I was really nervous to begin with as to how people might react to it but at the end of the day I need to take responsibility for my own health and not assume that everyone is clean and healthy! If your waiting for permission or for someone at work to be the first one so it’s not you then don’t. Turns out other staff members are now planning on wearing ones they have but they was all to afraid to rock the boat and do it first. Iv lost count how many people have thanked me for not being afraid to wear it and for showing people it’s not just the elderly it could/can effect and that someone else is taking it seriously. I just wanted to share my experience. Hope this helps anyone else who is trying to decide when is the right moment!

&#x200B;

By only ""advising"" and not enforcing they are essentially making it so that:

* They don't have to put protective measures in place (such as preventing bosses from firing people who choose to self-isolate and also freezing rent/gas bills) - as it is only ""advice"".
* Pubs and other small businesses cannot claim on their insurance as they aren't being forced to close - but they will likely suffer as people will not be using them.
* If you don't follow their advice, you are still to blame anyway - as you didn't follow it - even if your employer told you to still turn up to work with symptoms etc

We have wasted vital days with the eugenics experiment they call ""herd immunity"" which they have now back tracked on after finding it would result in unnecesary deaths [(no fuken sht)](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-uk-strategy-deaths).

We have gone from 14 to 7 to 14 days of isolation and other advice is drowned in waffle and their reasoning for their methods are [dismissed by hundreds of scientists](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18305856.coronavirus-scientists-claim-uk-strategy-risking-lives/).

I honestly don't know what is going on and essentially if they don't start trying to control this I will be on the verge of seeing it as genocide of the elderly.

The UK government’s dynamic risk assessments are inconsistent with government action across other European nations, and its planning principles do not align with current measures to discontinue testing of all potential cases. There is currently no publicly accessible research to support key decisions, aside from references to studies conducted outside of the UK and listing of scientific committees but no relevant available information. The strategy is poorly justified and there is no transparency as to the reasoning behind the ‘herd immunity’ approach. Public trust is low due to lack of transparency and this will reduce effectiveness of government strategies.

Let’s now all come together and demand transparency over the measures by putting pressure on the government to release a more scientifically robust document.

ffcogp,CoronavirusUK,Controversial opinion: No one is panic buying.,3/8/2020 21:41,"If I buy things I am just preparing and being reasonable if other people buy they are clearly panic buying and are a problem. This is the attitude we see here all the time. 

People are not panic buying they are stockpiling, they are doing now what you all did a month ago. They are late to the party but they are not different to you. Shops are not running out of supplies they simply operate on just in time delivery systems. It takes 50 people to buy twice as much toilet paper or bread for store to run out. It will be back on shelf next week. Noone is going to starve because of that. 

You all complained that people didn't prepare for it now when people are preparing for it this whole sub is like ""No, not like that!""

Shops running out of hand gel are good thing it means message is getting through and people are sanitizing their hands reducing virus spread and contributing to delay phase. We should be happy about it. If 5% people sanitized their hands 1 month ago and now we sudden have 10% sanitize their hands that is a good thing. Shops will take a little bit to adjust to new demand but this is surly reason to be happy because means people are starting to take this seriously isn't that what we all wanted for weeks now?

Same for food yes some people are going crazy with jars of food but who am I to blame them I run rotating 6 weeks worth of food supply in my house for past couple of years why would I judge anyone else doing the same. 

""But, it means I can't get any hand gel!"" you may say but what you are really saying is ""I want to panic buy as well but some people are faster than me"". Don't look down at another person trying to protect themselves or family. 2 months ago I got 50 bottles of alcohol gel for myself and family. If I see some more left now I buy 2 or 3 more and hand them out to friends protecting my immediate social circle making myself safer. I keep stock of 50 bottles still and when I get new one I replace the oldest one in my stores so when we do run out I still have supply to last any shortages. 

Stop judging people for prepping this is good thing it means that when we have 10s of 1000s infected noone will be walking around to shops because they have supplies at home. We are better of running low on stores now and everyone getting more than everyone trying to do their weekly shopping in 2 months time with infection in full swing.",70,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/ffcogp/controversial_opinion_no_one_is_panic_buying/

feqznl,CoronavirusUK,Perspective from a Brit in South Korea,3/7/2020 13:51,"I am constantly told to stay safe by people back home, but in truth I feel very safe in South Korea and am confident in Korean society and the government to contain and overcome the coronavirus. I am far more scared of what will happen in the UK. Primarily, this is because I have seen the kind of action that is required to contain this thing, and I cannot imagine Britain in 2020 will be able to do it. 

For one thing, there is people changing their behaviour. Britain seems to be divided into two camps: the bigger ""it's just the same as the flu / don't do anything different"" camp and the ""panic buy we're all going to die"" camp. What we will need is for the overwhelming majority to be in the sensible, cautious and compliant head-space that very few seem to be. This means everyone wearing masks (it's kind of pointless unless everyone does it) and more importantly widely available and constantly used hand sanitiser. Accepting major changes to day-to-day working and social life. 

The Korean government is tracing transmissions of the virus and testing 10s of thousands of people every day. It is hard to imagine the British public sector or the NHS having the capacity to do this in its current state. It is even harder to imagine them being able to provide proper treatment for the thousands of patients there are likely to be. You can see how many more people have died in Iran and Italy compared to South Korea, to see how big a difference better healthcare makes to how dangerous the virus is. 

Many things in Korea are closed like schools, and many people are not going to work or are working from home. The whole country here pretty much has access to very good broadband so this is possible. On the technology front as well, here we get alerts for where new cases appear, and we are told where the person went during the lead-up to them getting symptoms meaning that it is possible to avoid areas while they are disinfected and for any potentially infected people to go get tested. 

I could go on with more examples but this post is long enough already. The bottom line is that the scale, efficiency, and participation of the response here in South Korea has been pretty staggering to watch from the perspective of someone from the UK, and it concerns me that neither the populace nor the government are in a position to do the same if/when it really kicks off.",69,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/feqznl/perspective_from_a_brit_in_south_korea/

ITV News has obtained a recording of two Milanese doctors about the situations at their hospitals over coronavirus. Credit: AP

I'm just back from Italy and ""enjoying"" my first day of self-isolation.

Getting a real picture of how bad the situation is, especially in Lombardy and the north, has been really difficult for TV news because movement is so restricted, access to the overwhelmed hospitals impossible and the danger of infection so great.

But it's really important people understand just how bad things are, not least because it is where we may be headed.

So I will continue to write here about conversations, emails or recordings with those who are still under quarantine in Italy.

Some will be Britons who have stayed on, some Italians, some doctors. I start with a voice recording of two Milanese doctors speaking on WhatsApp about the situation at their hospitals.

The first identifies herself as Martina, but I believe she is Martina Crivellari, an intensive care cardiac anaesthesiologist at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan.

She said: ""There are a lot of young people in our Intensive Care Units (ICUs) - our youngest is a 38-year-old who had had no comorbidities (underlying health problems).

""A lot of patients need help with breathing but there are not enough ventilators.

""They've told us that starting from now we'll have to choose who to intubate - priority will go to the young or those without comorbidities.

""At Niguarda, the other big hospital in Milan, they are not intubating anyone over 60, which is really, really young.""

She added: ""This virus is so infectious that the only way to avoid a 'massacre' is to have the least number possible getting infected over the longest possible timescale.

""Right now, if we get 10,000 people in Italy in need of ventilators - when we only have 3,000 in the country - 7,000 people will die.

""Rome right now is like where Milan was 10 days ago. In 10 days there has been an incredible escalation.

""Lombardy, which has the best healthcare in the country, is collapsing, so I don’t dare to think what would happen in less efficient regions.

""We've had no critical cases among children but with children, viruses are much less aggressive - think chickenpox or measles.

""But the very young are crazy carriers.

""A child with no symptoms will go to visit its grandparents, and basically kill them. So it’s essential to avoid contact between them"".

The other voice on the recording is a male doctor who we have so far not been able to identify, except that he works at Niguarda Hospital in Milan, one of the biggest in the city.

""We have closed down entire wards, and reduced the number of beds in traditional wards.

""All operations have been cancelled, GP surgeries closed so the that the GPs can come in and be ward doctors.

""The number of ICU beds has been tripled. There was even pressure to take over our Cardiac ICU.""

""All the resuscitation bays are full. They’re having to triage, deciding who to intubate and who to let die.""

He added: ""You have no idea how many young people are here, I mean even 20-year-olds with no underlying conditions, in need of assisted breathing because of horrible pneumonia.

""There aren’t the resources to screen doctors for Covid-19 anymore - they’re just telling them 'stay home if you have symptoms, otherwise come to work'.""

He continued: ""Non-specialised medical graduates are being brought in.

""At Milan’s Policlinico hospital they are dealing with 50 new pneumonia cases every day"".

The World Health Organisation ranks Italy second in the world for health care provision, with only France rated higher. The UK is 18th.

That is across the whole country, but Lombardy is the richest region in Italy and likely to be way ahead of some regions in the south.

feea1v,CoronavirusUK,Misinformation regarding surgical masks - IMPORTANT,3/6/2020 22:33,"There's so many articles saying facemasks don't work, but they don't refer to a study, they simply refer to a Dr saying ""people are too stupid to use them so they're not effective."" Or ""they stop people touching their face so that's good"". Some even outright lie and say that they aren't effective at all. I think nurses and doctors get sick while using them and think they haven't worked, but the truth is they reduce the odds of getting sick but can never be 100%

[If you look for a study, you find that some even say surgical masks and n95/ffp3 are the same effectiveness](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903134732.htm)

[Other studies (by the UK government!) find that surgical masks offer some protection but not as much as the rated masks](https://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrhtm/rr619.htm)

[This article compared all masks, taking into account the fit and the level of particles that made it through the mask](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/coronavirus-pollution-masks-n95-surgical-mask/) \- it's not a perfect study, but at least they actually tested it.

I saw one more that found them 50% effective and one that found them 30% effective, however I have tried to find one that says they don't work and I can't find any.

Its not about going against the status quo, its about, for important topics, looking at studies and forming your own opinion rather than just following everyone else's. I've spent the time and looked through 5-6 unbiased studies, they all say that masks work.

You have to also remember that masks remind you to not touch your face, so they may be even better than the studies make out.

People in the UK are the only ones this ignorant about it. Too many sheep, and honestly I don't blame people for being 'followers', when I wear a mask I get people making fun of me. It's horrendous. Why would medical staff have them as their mandatory kit if they don't work?

It's your responsibility to make sure people you care about know that masks do work, and that people need to do their bit and spread the news and tell people to not make fun of others. You can still get masks, I was able to find bulk masks FFP3 for 70p each. I bought 100 to distribute between friends and family, I'm making progress on making them believe that masks work and you do need them. Opinions on masks need to change as this disease progresses, otherwise this disease will tear through our country and annihilate our economy. There's going to be a massive mistrust in our government for telling people masks don't work, but it's our responsibility to be critical thinkers and research ourselves.",70,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/feea1v/misinformation_regarding_surgical_masks_important/

fhmw6o,CoronavirusUK,In the face of government inaction - let's start planning for what we can do collectively.,3/13/2020 4:22,"As we move closer to an Italy/Wuhan scenario in the UK, what measures can we take now that might make a collective difference? I'm not talking about individual preparation, but things that will support our neighbours and communities. With the evident failure of the government to take any serious steps - we need to think about these things together. So here's my initial list...

&#x200B;

1. **If you can, work from home**. The more we do this the more we're contributing to a reduced spread of the disease. The more we do this, the more we make it normal for our colleagues and others to do the same. The more we do this, the more we pressure our bosses to take steps to better facilitate this option. Obviously not everyone can do this, but those of us who can should.
2. **Don't forget about those on zero hour contracts, service sector jobs, and precarious work.** We need to keep hammering home the point that not everyone can quarantine at home for an indefinite period of time. The government needs to provide support to those without access to sick pay, leave, or unable to carry out their work at home. This is not just an individual issue, those who *must* work will obviously continue to do so even if they are sick - this is a sure fire way of spreading the disease even more rapidly.
3. **Don't be judgemental, haughty or arrogant to those who've just figured out what's going on**. Many of us have seen this coming for a long time, and taken our individual precautions. But we can't blame those who bought the 'it's just the flu' narrative or just didn't bother digging into what's been happening over the past months. Instead, we need to patiently explain and support people. We should expect our friends and colleagues to be scared, confused and angry - let's help them through it.
4. **Find ways to convey the seriousness of the situation.** Again, this is not about scaremongering or badgering people. But we need to find ways to make people realise what's going on and what might happen. Personally, I've felt it most effective to focus on the question of ICU and hospital infrastructure. It's easy to understand and brings home the necessity of immediate action.
5. **Remind people that it's not just about us as individuals - our individual behaviour has a social impact.** Those of us who are young and healthy may be relatively less at risk. But ignoring symptoms or acting as if we'll just get over it puts others at risk. So the next time someone says 80% of people will be fine - ask them, well what about the other 20%?
6. **Put pressure on your boss/university/school to be proactive and not reactive.** If enough voices start hassling them, we can encourage them to take steps that the government isn't willing to do. Point to other schools and workplaces who are taking these actions (we're building a great collection of work notices on this sub). Don't take the 'We're following PHE advice' line as an answer to your concerns. Make this an issue of workplace safety and labour rights.
7. **Get to know your neighbours and make sure you touch base with your relatives and loved ones.** Do you have the phone number of your neighbours? Are there people living alone on your street or in your building, who might be scared or need reassurance in case of lockdown? Let people know that you are there for them and willing to help. Can you set up neighbourhood networks to regularly check in on people who might be elderly or living alone?
8. **Give blood!** It is very likely in the case of a prolonged lockdown where people are frightened to leave their houses that we will see shortages in blood donations. Now is the time to donate.

What with the Government's guidelines yesterday, I want to say something. I work as a chef, I have done since dropping out of uni and kitchens have become a home-away-from-home for me. The advice we were given yesterday is probably the worst news we could have had, especially for small independents. We have essentially been told, customers shouldn't come in but if you close, insurance will not cover losses. It also means that if we stay away from work with health concerns, there is no guarantee of any form of pay or recompense. Our owner has been pretty good through this, including saying if anyone has symptoms they must stay away from work.

 However, I know that many in my industry have a stoic view towards illness and will continue to go in. I also know that as an asthmatic, the guidelines suggest I should do everything possible to socially distance myself. This leaves me, and others in my trade, in quite a quandary and the massive uncertainty isn't doing anything for our collective mental health. This is a very worrying time in the hospitality industry and many independents will not make it through this.

On a positive note, I have been in contact with my local hospital (a large city centre one) to see if I can set up a stall outside serving healthy, one pot/soup/stew style food. They seem keen on the idea and I would be hesitant to charge, instead accepting any donations to cover costs. NHS workers may struggle to find time to make packed lunches and the food service within their institutions may come under considerable strain.

Honestly in disbelief, despite how bad it's looking in europe, specifically Italy right now, and without a doubt it's only going to keep getting worse before it gets any better here. People are still joking about it.
I've seen people on my Facebook sharing the news announcing Italy's lockdown and their response is along the lines of ""fuck that"" ""the biggest problem isnt the stupid virus it's the news making it out to be worse than it is"" and then adding their silly little emojis like 👌🏻 because they genuinely believe in their low iq brains that they're smarter and more clued up than the people making these decisions and all the top scientists and medical professionals world wide stating just how big and bad COVID-19 is(half of them don't even know covid19)... Even a country really not too far from us going on complete lockdown isn't enough to wake people up.

 Fuck me honestly. People are so dumb, we're fucked, ignorance will be the death of us.

fga1fh,CoronavirusUK,Nobody will care until its too late: I am so over it.,3/10/2020 15:22,"As I write this my chest feels heavy, my nose is running, and my throat is sore. It might not be anything, or it could be everything I've been worrying about for the past 2 months. I finished work early yesterday and I'm staying at home today. If I feel like this tomorrow I'll call 111 and see what they say.

Nobody I've talked to during this bleak period has given a shit. It's ""just a cold"" they say, ""the flu kills more people"". They roll their eyes when I tell them about the acceleration of cases in Europe, ""that won't happen here, and if it does it'll only kill the oldest people who were gonna die anyway"" - because fuck old people I guess? I've been called daft, a hypercondriac, a conspiracy theorist. People have laughed at me and given me weird looks for wearing gloves, and using hand sanitizer. People cough and sneeze without covering their mouths, and then accuse me of being rude when I reel away from them. Most of these people are over 40+, with underlying health issues, yet they don't seem to have a care in the world. My relationship has been on the rocks, because my girlfriend is genuinely convinced I've lost my mind, and she's asked me to see a doctor for mental health support. 

When everyone drills it into your brain that you're being ridiculous, you start to believe them. There's only so many times you can be called crazy before it starts to really negatively impact you.

So what did I do? I got on a very busy train to see my girlfriend last weekend. Even thought it went against everything I believed in, because if I didn't I was scared she would break up with me. And I was just being silly, right?

I'm now ill. I'm praying that this is really just a cold. At 27, I am not too worried about my own health, but I could have unwittingly spread it to everyone around me. Most of my coworkers are considerably older than me, and not in the best of health. I will probably survive this, but the same can't be said for them. 

I tried so hard to be conscientious of other people's health. But in the end nobody cared about mine. And now we might all end up getting it.

I'm absolutely exhausted from all of this. Sorry for the rant, but I really am at my wits end.",62,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fga1fh/nobody_will_care_until_its_too_late_i_am_so_over/

ffivw2,CoronavirusUK,Depressing unwillingness of the government to tell the public harsh truths,3/9/2020 4:49,"I was initially pretty optimistic about how the UK Government was responding to coronavirus - we seemed to be doing a lot of testing and pro-active contact tracing, getting the message out, etc. - and certainly put a lot of other countries to shame on that side of things. Like most people reading this, I love the NHS but am all too aware of its lack of funding and the shortage of beds that means that a crisis like the ones that have unfolded in Italy, Iran etc. - which now seems inevitable here - will hit us hard.   


What is depressing me now is that government's refusal to acknowledge that difficult decisions are going to have to be made, and the dishonesty with which they are treating the general public at this point in time, specifically when it comes to what is and isn't effective at dealing with the virus.  


We've heard from officials briefings that masks are ""ineffective"" and that cancelling social gatherings/events don't work - just recently there's a whole thread where some Gov source is briefing this to Robert Peston. But we know scientifically, logically, it completely stands to reason that both of these things are \*untrue\*.   


The reality is that masks can be effective at preventing infection if used properly - but we don't have anything like enough of them, and they should, rightly, be in the hands of the healthcare professionals who most need to be well and are going to be most exposed to the virus over the coming weeks. \*If the government admitted that masks work, but they are needed for healthcare professionals, rather than lying to people, perhaps it would be easier to trust them.\*   


Similarly now with respect to the banning of public gatherings, which has happened all over Europe - indeed just hours ago France is banning all gatherings over 1,000. The briefing to the media is not the reality of the situation, but a lie: ""this doesn't work and is just a measure to appease people who are worried."" Well, excuse me, but I'd love to see the science that demonstrates that a society where people are constantly running around in mass gatherings and going to work and school rather than working from home has a greater rate of infection. They're not being honest, and saying: ""there's a cost benefit analysis to taking on these measures, and we're currently calculating that the costs of doing these things outweigh the benefits, but that may well change in the future.""   


By putting out this narrative that this \*doesn't work\*, they are doing three things:

1) Covering their own asses by claiming that not taking these measures isn't exposing some members of the public to additional risk, because they wouldn't work anyway

2) Making it more difficult to get public buy-in to agree with the inevitable disruption to our lives that will have to happen as this crisis escalates, and increasing the chances that the measures will be ineffective when they eventually decide to go ahead with them

3) Refusing to level with the public that, yes, difficult decisions are going to have to be made with pros and cons on both sides - the economic disruption for shutting down schools and workplaces will be enormous, and that can harm people just as much as coronavirus - and therefore absolving themselves of responsibility if things go wrong.   


I still hear people I respect telling me that this is no worse than the flu - honestly, the fact that this hasn't been drilled into people's heads yet will cause immense harm. It means that people won't take washing their hands and avoiding large crowds seriously. It means that people coming back from holiday won't self-isolate properly. It means that people won't give their employees time off if they have flu-like symptoms before they can get tested. This is all going to contribute to the rapid spread of this virus. And what is the rationale for saying these things at this point? Panic-buying has started already; this is the #1 news story every day and night; people can read the tabloids for sensationalist headlines. Be honest with people: from what we know, this is 10-20x deadlier than flu. Be honest with people: if we don't take steps to slow the spread of this virus, our healthcare system will get overwhelmed, and thousands of people will die unnecessarily.

It's cheap to worry about politics at a time like this, because, guess what? Every incumbent government is going to be criticised for its response, and every political system is going to have to find ways to deal with difficult times ahead, particularly as more and more people wake up to this threat. You can't escape that. People will criticise you if you lockdown and criticise you if you don't. That's what people \*do.\* But I would at least be more willing not to criticise the government if they were a little more honest about the decisions they're taking. Compared to a lot of places we've done well so far, although the global response has been pretty inadequate and pretty late on average. Let's not ruin it.

I’m youngish (early 30’s) and otherwise quite healthy, so something like this isn’t normal for me at all. 

My GP really wanted to test me but was unable to specifically request the test, as I didn’t satisfy the requirements of foreign travel to an affected area, or contact with a known case. Instead she sent off a throat swab and sputum test on Wednesday and when the results came back Friday she told me that alongside the standard throat swab tests, they had also tested my swab for COVID-19 (which was negative)! 

This was a surprise to us both as the GP had no information to say this test would be included as part of a standard throat swab test. Maybe this has changed very recently? 

Just thought it might be worth throwing this out there as I know a lot of people are desperate to get tested, but like me don’t satisfy the standard requirements. I honestly don’t know if this is the standard case for every throat swab now, or whether mine was tested additionally due to my symptoms. 

I haven’t seen anyone mention anything like this on here, so thought I would highlight what seems like a very strange case.

We're a group of medical students from the University of Edinburgh who, under senior, professorial supervision, are investigating the perception of COVID-19 in the general public and healthcare professionals. This data can then be used to assess the strength of government communication regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and elucidate areas for potential improvement.

Perhaps more importantly, feedback can be used to make more informed decisions on the next steps that the government and NHS take in the coming weeks and months.

CMO/PHE can give advice, but politicians need to translate that into decisions. If you just parrot that ""we are in a mix of Contain and Delay"" then that's just not good enough. Be clear in your message and take some decisive actions.

Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan to some extent, Korea before they got the shock from that cult - they all took decisive action:

* widespread use of masks by public (Singapore it stopped later, I know)
* govt telling companies to allow workers to work remotely
* deep cleansing/disinfection of all public transport daily with new chemicals
* isolating in hospital every infected, not just at home where their family members can still spread it
* quarantining traced contacts for two weeks in dedicated quarantine centers or ankle tagging
* closing schools
* banning large gatherings
* closing playgrounds

Your public health authority frankly won't have the balls to advise these steps. This is down to government.

As that guy on Ch.4 News said last night, you have to go to war against the virus. Don't wave the white flag already by going to the ""Delay"" phase and therefore admitting you already gave up on the virus without even putting up a fight.

Our own government aren't even taking it serious enough, they said themselves that they don't want to close school's because then the parents won't be able to work..

Over the past several days I’ve felt the walls caving in on me and the power I thought I had over the situation crumble away. My work place is semi closing down and splitting us into teams we are due to take shifts in our teams, effectively working until one team becomes infected so the other team can soldier on. This plan has been echoed by Boris, we are being ordered to work until we drop like flies. My colleagues think it’s just the flu, my family think It’ll all be alright and still continue to take public transport (London based).

figfus,CoronavirusUK,A harsh reality,3/14/2020 18:39,"Ok. Firstly, a lot of people probably aren't going to want to hear this but from the comments I keep reading I feel something needs to be said. Secondly, I've gone back and forth about whether to make this post or not and certainly take no joy in doing so.

A lot of people were upset and/or angered by the way Boris Johnson opened his address the other day. A lot of people are upset/angered/confused about the approach the government is taking. A lot of people think we're being thrown under the bus.

There's a few realities we all need to accept and the sooner we do the sooner we can understand where we stand.

Regardless of what approach the government takes (barring the most extreme) some things are certain.

● This thing is going to continue spreading and infecting people.

● The NHS will almost certainly get overwhelmed and overstretched for some time.

● People are going to die. A lot of them. It's sad. Really sad. Tragic. But it's the reality. NOTHING we do now is going to change the fact that we are going to see a death toll that noone is going to like. The only thing we can do now is try to manage that number the best we can.

Now, whether the government's approach is the right one or not is a whole different debate but people keep saying ""Are they really going to allow x amount of people die?"" Again, people are going to die. The only thing we can do now is try to keep that number as low as possible.

So whose fault is it we find ourselves in this situation? The government for not acting earlier? Personally I don't think so. Maybe, just maybe, if we had managed to get fully ahead of this and put actions in place before we even saw the 1st UK infection we might have been in a different scenario. But the minute that virus hit the shores this scenario was almost inevitable.

I know a lot of people aren't going to like this post. Hell, I don't even know if it will get left up. My intentions of this post isn't to troll, to upset, to scare. In fact if anything the opposite. It just feels like too many people still think that halting this thing dead in it's tracks and escaping with barely any more deaths is still an option when it isn't. I want to say maybe if we can accept that we can feel better about the situation with less anxiety, less anger , but that feels wrong to suggest.

fieyrv,CoronavirusUK,The govt strategy on Coronavirus - Professor Ian Donald,3/14/2020 15:49,"https://twitter.com/iandonald_psych/status/1238518371651649538

  
1. The govt strategy on #Coronavirus is more refined than those used in other countries and potentially very effective. But it is also riskier and based on a number of assumptions. They need to be correct, and the measures they introduce need to work when they are supposed to. 

2. This all assumes I'm correct in what I think the govt are doing and why. I could be wrong - and wouldn't be surprised. But it looks to me like. . . 

3. A UK starting assumption is that a high number of the population will inevitably get infected whatever is done – up to 80%. As you can’t stop it, so it is best to manage it.
There are limited health resources so the aim is to manage the flow of the seriously ill to these. 

4. The Italian model the aims to stop infection. The UKs wants infection BUT of particular categories of people. The aim of the UK is to have as many lower risk people infected as possible. Immune people cannot infect others; the more there are the lower the risk of infection 

5. That's herd immunity.
Based on this idea, at the moment the govt wants people to get infected, up until hospitals begin to reach capacity. At that they want to reduce, but not stop infection rate. Ideally they balance it so the numbers entering hospital = the number leaving. 

6. That balance is the big risk.
All the time people are being treated, other mildly ill people are recovering and the population grows a higher percent of immune people who can’t infect. They can also return to work and keep things going normally - and go to the pubs. 

7. The risk is being able to accurately manage infection flow relative to health case resources. Data on infection rates needs to be accurate, the measures they introduce need to work and at the time they want them to and to the degree they want, or the system is overwhelmed. 

8. Schools: Kids generally won’t get very ill, so the govt can use them as a tool to infect others when you want to increase infection. When you need to slow infection, that tap can be turned off – at that point they close the schools. Politically risky for them to say this. 

9. The same for large scale events - stop them when you want to slow infection rates; turn another tap off. This means schools etc are closed for a shorter period and disruption generally is therefore for a shorter period, AND with a growing immune population. This is sustainable 

10. After a while most of the population is immune, the seriously ill have all received treatment and the country is resistant. The more vulnerable are then less at risk. This is the end state the govt is aiming for and could achieve. 

11. BUT a key issue during this process is protection of those for whom the virus is fatal. It's not clear the full measures there are to protect those people. It assumes they can measure infection, that their behavioural expectations are met - people do what they think they will 

12. The Italian (and others) strategy is to stop as much infection as possible - or all infection. This is appealing, but then what? The restrictions are not sustainable for months. So the will need to be relaxed. But that will lead to reemergence of infections. 

13. Then rates will then start to climb again. So they will have to reintroduce the restrictions each time infection rates rise. That is not a sustainable model and takes much longer to achieve the goal of a largely immune population with low risk of infection of the vulnerable 

14. As the government tries to achieve equilibrium between hospitalisations and infections, more interventions will appear. It's perhaps why there are at the moment few public information films on staying at home. They are treading a tight path, but possibly a sensible one. 

15. This is probably the best strategy, but they should explain it more clearly. It relies on a lot of assumptions, so it would be good to know what they are - especially behavioural.

I have come up with a new solution, it does not involve happy birthday. It’s called POO HANDS. 

It goes like this. Pretend your hands are covered in poo. You can be creative with this. What ever poo you want - human poo is up there, dog poo, or if you’re a vegan maybe horse poo. Cow pat could be good for visuals because you can really get those hands stuck in there. 

And then proceed to wash your hands like they are covered in poo. You wouldn’t casually be washing your hands while singing Happy Birthday to yourself. You’d really scrub them and get all into the nooks and under nails and get every tiny bit off your hands. You’d really get that soap on there and work them. Once you are satisfied the imaginary poo is no longer an issue, you can stop. 

For the more easily offended you could perhaps pretend to have bread dough hands or olive oil hands or whatever but I just don’t think it is as effective. 

If it reassures you to sing while washing your hands, you can still do this. But with this method you can sing what ever you like! You can do the whole of Bohemian Rhapsody if that makes your day better.

Good luck and God speed and remember POO HANDS.

Then China started constructing massive hospitals within a week, authorities banned citizens from being in public without a mask, next thing we knew entire cities and millions of people were being locked down. I'm sure you've seen the video of people screaming from their apartments out of frustration due to the quarantine. At that time I was optimistic and hoping that it wouldn't occur in the UK on the same level it did in Hubei province. But I think we all know where we're headed by now.

Realistically according to most experts, a vaccine is at least 12 months away, and even that is an optimistic goal and would be a world record. The virus will likely come and go in waves (similar to the Spanish Flu in 1918) - and each wave of the virus results in uncertainty in terms of mutations, and effects on patients, or the CFR. So we will not be in the safe zone by the end of summer, or even end of the year.

 In the meantime we know very little about this virus - about whether reinfections are possible, or whether it causes long term health complications, as SARS did - which coronavirus is 80% genetically identical to. In up to 40% of SARS recovered patients, they reported experiencing chronic fatigue syndrome, and some patients had evidence of reduced lung capacity/function (scarring).

The director of the CDC stated for coronavirus:

&#x200B;

> *I think this virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we'll get community based transmission and you can start to think about it like seasonal flu. The only difference is we don't understand this virus  Dr. Robert Redfield* 

&#x200B;

Honestly the the last month and a half has felt more like six months. It feels like time has slowed. 

I think society will change quite a lot as a result of this virus, even more so than as a result of 9/11. Hopefully for the better somehow. But until a vaccine is developed, OR the virus mutating into a much less deadlier strain, OR it somehow dying out by itself (via an absolute miracle), I feel like the next few months are going to be a struggle for most - economically, mentally and physically.",49,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/feks0q/anyone_else_just_tired_of_this_and_cant_wait_for/

fie5m9,CoronavirusUK,“Coronavirus” is actually a generic term.

I present to you some thoughts on language.

Coronavirus is actually the name for a whole family of respiratory viruses found in mammals and birds.  SARS is a coronavirus, as is the common cold.  COVID19 is the name of the current version of this new strain of virus (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) . 

 The new virus itself is designated as SARS-CoV-2, because it shares a common viral ancestor with the original SARS virus.   If it had been commonly referred to as SARSv2 maybe people would have taken it more seriously from the start.  Naming it “Coronavirus” is basically the same as “Generic Respiratory Virus”.  It’s an empty name that offers no reference point for people to understand what it does.

In Singapore, Australisia and the government is concerned about the will of the people and are being open and honest with them. They are having 1 hour + press conferences live with 3-4 members of government. 

In typical fashion, we have a 30 second clip where our leaders follow a script that says we have a great NHS, and have everything undercontrol. 

This virus operates in a completely ruthless and in a very out of control manner. 

I know that in a crisis you will burn yourself out if you are constantly rehearsing scripts and are not being your natural self. 

Matt hancock is burning himself out and won't last alongwith the rest of them. 

If I was in charge I would immediately:

Cancel all flights to Iran, South Korea and Italy,Japan until they show they have no new cases for 2 days (like Hong Kong and Singapore) 

All schools are closed and turn them into field hospitals with oxygen for all beds. (I have a white paper that we need to follow to do that. (this will give capacity for the 250000 beds Scotland needs alone) we need that done now. 

I would immediately process a payment to all citizens of £300 a month for the next 3 month's ( hong kong just did this and gave everyone £1000) to stop panic)

I would be rapidly making a mask factory in every city. Masks do work to slow the spread. Even 5% helps - everyone on this thread needs to start wearing masks now to make it socially acceptable ASAP. 

I would remove all cash in circulation now and ask everyone to go cashless. Only Old people will be excused for now, be will be encouraged to use contact less. 

I would ban mass gatherings this should have been done last week. 

I would temporarily nationalise and take over all UK airlines as they will need them to get supplies across the country as food distributors will have difficulty with distribution in lock down. 

I would immediately be protecting the areas of the country that produces the most food. (So I would immediately be designating that entire area a special care zone to those areas) we only grow 60% of the uks food needs. If that is screwed we will have social unrest.

The medics (CMO and the other guy) have advised the PM and cabinet that **this cannot be stopped** (the ""other guy"" even said as much) and that is why they are not going to war on this virus.

**They actually want this infection to roll through the UK, just in a controlled manner so it happens when bed capacity is at it's largest.**

They are **not** willing to go to war on this virus. Other countries are going to war and with (presumably massive resources aimed at) a strong effort to if not wipe it out then to keep cases at an absolute minimum (say less than 100 overall in their countries) and to keep it there with these measures. Result: ICU will not burst it's capacity and lives will be saved.

**The UK government doesn't want to do this**.  It wants it to peak at a time of it's choosing, capacity will probably break but it will be better than doing at some other time of the year, they don't want a second peak.

Why is going to war on this virus good enough for Asian countries, Israel and others but not good enough for the UK and seemingly the rest of the EU? Is it one rule for Asians and other rule for Caucasians?

Boris has f\*\*ked up here. Other public health authorities in other countries don't agree with ours, and yet he refuses to listen to anything other than his own official's opinions. They are wrong but he doesn't have the balls to overrule him. I find it incredible that Churchill is his hero.

It gives a few details including location. Looks like data is aggregated from various sources, including news reports of ‘suspected’ cases possibly. 

I sent the creator an email & thanked him, advised him to update it to include a “-“ when data isn’t available for a subject, so the tables are easier to read & he did it. Rather than simply complaining about its inadequacies & dismissing it, maybe send a suggestion to the creator yourself.

fizzmd,CoronavirusUK,UK Plan of Action Explained by Professor Ian Donald,3/15/2020 19:29,"I found this Tweet and I understood why the UK is acting the way it has so far and I thought it could be helpful to others as well.

“The govt strategy on Coronavirus is more refined than those used in other countries and potentially very effective. But it is also riskier and based on a number of assumptions. They need to be correct, and the measures they introduce need to work when they are supposed to. This all assumes I'm correct in what I think the govt are doing and why. I could be wrong - and wouldn't be surprised. But it looks to me like...

A UK starting assumption is that a high number of the population will inevitably get infected whatever is done – up to 80%. As you can’t stop it, so it is best to manage it. There are limited health resources so the aim is to manage the flow of the seriously ill to these. 

The Italian model the aims to stop infection. The UKs wants infection BUT of particular categories of people. The aim of the UK is to have as many lower risk people infected as possible. Immune people cannot infect others; the more there are the lower the risk of infection. That's herd immunity. Based on this idea, at the moment the govt wants people to get infected, up until hospitals begin to reach capacity. At that they want to reduce, but not stop infection rate. Ideally they balance it so the numbers entering hospital = the number leaving. That balance is the big risk.

All the time people are being treated, other mildly ill people are recovering and the population grows a higher percent of immune people who can’t infect. They can also return to work and keep things going normally - and go to the pubs. The risk is being able to accurately manage infection flow relative to health case resources. Data on infection rates needs to be accurate, the measures they introduce need to work and at the time they want them to and to the degree they want, or the system is overwhelmed.

Schools: Kids generally won’t get very ill, so the govt can use them as a tool to infect others when you want to increase infection. When you need to slow infection, that tap can be turned off – at that point they close the schools. Politically risky for them to say this.

The same for large scale events - stop them when you want to slow infection rates; turn another tap off. This means schools etc are closed for a shorter period and disruption generally is therefore for a shorter period, AND with a growing immune population. This is sustainable. After a while most of the population is immune, the seriously ill have all received treatment and the country is resistant. The more vulnerable are then less at risk. 

This is the end state the govt is aiming for and could achieve. BUT a key issue during this process is protection of those for whom the virus is fatal. It's not clear the full measures there are to protect those people. It assumes they can measure infection, that their behavioural expectations are met - people do what they think they will.

The Italian (and others) strategy is to stop as much infection as possible - or all infection. This is appealing, but then what? The restrictions are not sustainable for months. So the will need to be relaxed. But that will lead to reemergence of infections. Then rates will then start to climb again. So they will have to reintroduce the restrictions each time infection rates rise. That is not a sustainable model and takes much longer to achieve the goal of a largely immune population with low risk of infection of the vulnerable. As the government tries to achieve equilibrium between hospitalisations and infections, more interventions will appear. It's perhaps why there are at the moment few public information films on staying at home. They are treading a tight path, but possibly a sensible one. This is probably the best strategy, but they should explain it more clearly. It relies on a lot of assumptions, so it would be good to know what they are - especially behavioural. Most encouraging, it's way too clever for BorisJohnson to have had any role in developing.”

fhwc2l,CoronavirusUK,Why are we not given a choice to temporarily remove our children from school?,3/13/2020 16:19,"The petition to close schools has over 423,000 signatures (and climbing rapidly) that is a huge amount of parents that are able and willing to withdraw their children from school. Surely allowing these parents to remove children if they choose to would limit the spread until the NHS is in a position where it is not overwhelmed by the usual winter flu/vomiting bugs. 

It's just a few more weeks until the Easter holidays, I am perfectly happy to have the children at home with me until then, how is it any different to the amount of time they have off for summer holidays? 

It seems like a sensible idea to be given the option and I'm sure many others feel the same as I do, so what can be done?


*Edit* 

I should have added that these are the penalties we face if we choose to keep them at home (per child, I have four).

“There’s simply no need to panic buy”
“80% of the population may contract the disease” 

The WHO has fatality rate at 3.4 %. Equates to 1.7 million deaths in the U.K.  

This is a half decent reason to panic buy. This is what we are faced with. Reports that most of us will get it. A 3.4 % fatality rate (you’d hope the WHO wouldn’t lie about this at least). 

The message out there is so mixed I don’t think most people know what to think. The NHS nurses and doctors sas we are not ready. And Boris says we are well equipped. (We know it’s the first one). 

I’d say right now get those foods you really like but are unlikely to be able to get soon (stuffed piquant peppers for me). I’ve never seen operation feed the nation been talked about before. 

So maybe not panic. But certainly pay attention to what’s being said. Look at it like this. Operation feed the nation means rations, and basic food.

fblj0u,CoronavirusUK,GPs thoughts on a Pandemic,3/1/2020 8:01,"This is thoughts from my father on 26th Jan

***Pandemic thoughts from the front line***

*I am a GP aged 64 who has worked for 35 years in the NHS. I believe we need a bottom up approach if there is a pandemic threat and I will concentrate on suggested measures to consider at practice level. I hope this will open up a conversation and sharing of ideas.*

***Staff.*** *in Wuhan the weak spot seems to be the health service which has been seen to be collapsing after only a couple of weeks. There are videos on line of exhausted demoralised staff working themselves into a state of collapse with film of doctors falling to the ground. The government has had to fly in an extra 1000 clinicians to help out. This is possible in the early stages of an infection but at the rate they are having to quarantine (currently 56m) there soon won’t be any spare clinicians. It would be wise to work hard to prevent exhaustion of staff by any means possible. They will soon become exhausted with the added work load and anxiety of patients.*

***Visits*** *We will tell patients to stay at home if they have a fever. However many will have other additional worries like secondary bronchitis, confusion gut problems etc. They may need a visit. Who will do this? I would suggest one partner per practice draws the short straw and confines themself to dealing with feverish patients.*

*Personally I would rather get the infection early in a pandemic; hopefully get over it, and then be able to work without restrictions or fear. Looking at the hazmat suits that clinicians have had to wear for Ebola or the corona virus it’s clear that working in them is exhausting. To do a long day in such a suit and then again all week would I assume lower ones immunity sufficiently to put one at increased risk of serious illness. That poor doctor aged 62 who died after treating the initial cases is a warning of the risks. A second doctor aged 51 died on the same day with acute MI. This suggests the stress may have been severe to bring on the coronary.*

***The medical workforce*** *would struggle so I think the government should plan to relax the rules over who can practice. For instance they should encourage retired doctors to be allowed to work without worrying about indemnity, appraisal or the mandatory training. CQC and QOF should be suspended with the QOF fees being carried over from the previous year’s attainment. There is a large workforce out there that could be mobilised and help enormously.*

***Hospitals*** *would very soon come to a crisis. Our local DGH had to declare an ‘opal’ emergency a few weeks ago with 160 patients awaiting a bed. This was without any flu epidemic or freezing weather. I guess the hospital would stop all non-essential work like orthopaedics, routine cardiology and gastroenterology, physio and outpatient follow ups and monitoring of non-critical patients. Whether these doctors and nurses would be prepared to work on fever wards however is another matter. In the film ‘contagion’ the nurses went on strike as the protocols for such work were not sorted out. I’m afraid we would all be working without much protocol guidance. It would be crisis guidance which is why it pays to think about it in advance.*

***Drugs*** *might become scarce if there is economic disruption and people vote or are told to stay at home. If schools are shut parents won’t be able to go to work. Many drugs would no longer be available and it behoves us to decide in advance which ones we and the patients need to worry about. These could readily be stopped for months and restarted when normality returns. Such drugs would include statins, bone protective agents, vitamins and minerals, many psychiatric drugs for mild anxiety or depression or insomnia. levothyroxine. Our staff would need such a list to be able to reassured anxious patients unable to get their normal prescription. Other drugs would be essential and a list of them would include insulins, antitbiotics, antipsychotics. Anticoagulants and antihypertensives are a grey area that would need individual decisions. This is all relevant as it may come to non clinical staff to sort prescriptions and triage the simple decisions such as re-prescribing repeat medications. EPS (electronic prescribing) will help, hopefully, to automate and reduce the workload. People will try to avoid the surgery as a dangerous place of infection and if we can steer them to chemists instead that will help.*

***We see a lot of trivia*** *and the worried well. We would need to deal with them robustly. I would plan a code of TW (time waster) and after two entries of this would refuse any further appointments saving them for genuine patients. In non-crisis times this would soon land us before the GMC/NHSE with a complaint. In crisis there would have to be a general amnesty for clinicians to spare them complaints when working under such stress. It would be nice to be able to tackle these time wasters without fear of redress. Additionally CQC, appraisals and mandatory training should be waived for that year. Finances should be based on previous years income and no detailed paper work expected of the poor beleaguered practice management. These measures would free up enough time to allow us to deal with the urgent workload adequately and perhaps without collapsing primary care. I assume secondary care would collapse and we are the advocates and helpers of our own patients and I personally feel a duty to look after them even if my pay masters and bosses at NHSE fall apart. and don’t offer much support.*

***Security*** *Patients can become aggressive when anxious. This may cause scenes at reception. We may need to support front of house and I doubt the police will be able to help. We might have more luck asking for volunteer help from our own patients. Many will be stuck at home unable to work and in my experience there is enough altruism out there to make it worth asking for help.*

***Isolation*** *One of the main social issues currently is loneliness. Many live alone and don’t go out and interact much with society so no one else apart from perhaps us knows their situation. They would be very vulnerable especially to the corona virus that makes people ill for a couple of weeks. Modern society has little sense of community and its not helped by social media where people can do all their socialising on line. Hopefully this won’t go down and will be useful for people calling for help. The best defence in a time of crisis is however a good sense of community with people being aware of vulnerable neighbours. If areas of maybe a few hundred people, say an estate or a few roads were put together as a ‘community’ and a few individuals could be encouraged to mobilise their neighbours to organise, this would make a huge difference. Surgeries and churches could help with this but it would be down to individual areas to work out how much they could do.*

***Recovery*** *The most valuable people in an epidemic are those who have recovered. They no longer have to be careful or fearful. They could play a disproportionately helpful role if they can be mobilised. I doubt they would be prepared to be co-opted by local authorities or government as the job would seem too huge and distant. It’s much better to be asked by the local surgery to help locally. Again it helps being organised into local communities.*

We're also aware, that for a long time we had masses of ""it's just the flu"" ""flu is worse"" amongst many more phrases to poopoo those who thought to take this seriously.

Now, if we were to ""lockdown"" people, some/many of whom, think this isn't serious, would those people take advice and stay home? Of course not because it's ""just the flu"".

But, if you give people snippets more, and more and more, some of those people will come around to the idea that maybe it's not.

This information is 100% necessary for citizens to make informed decisions about themselves, their children and their family - even more so for those who are in particular risk groups.

Frankly, the level of deception and obfuscation by PHE is criminal. The information is delayed, (often late by their own arbitrary deadlines) woefully inaccurate by their own admission and their location information is so ambiguous to be basically meaningless.

The've been giving journalists and the public the runaround since the first case in Staycity in York. Keep calm carry on, don't panic the public, underplay it - keep the broader wheels of the economy turning, lie on question time about food supplies. 

This is all well and good, until you have a significant outbreak and a totally unprepared public who are loafing around spouting utterly spurious bullshit like - 'the flu kills thousands every year', laughing their way into total chaos. 

\--

It is clear now that the UK is headed for a large scale outbreak over the coming weeks and months. The hospitals will be overwhelmed and thousands will die needlessly. 

None of this had to happen. Commercial aviation could have been halted, proper tracking and transparent information about all cases and clusters would have markedly slowed the spread. 

Where are the stockpiles of remedesvir and chloroquine? Where are the trucks full of oxygen concentrators ready to roll out to people's homes? Why are mass events still happening? Importations daily with flights every hour.

\--

The public will look back and guess what the story will be:

'nobody could have predicted', 'truly exceptional circumstances', 'no-one could have fore-sore what happened in 2020' 

When in reality it was entirely obvious. 

Novel, highly infectious respiratory pathogen which is deadly in >1% of cases and causes severe disease in >15% of infected. Asymptomatic shedding means that temperature checks and symptom isolation are impossible. Follow this to its logical conclusion:

Hospital system collapses from demand, huge pressure on basic public services and the rule of law, economic crisis larger than the great depression. This was obvious first week of Feb. 

And now here we are. This is not a just world, but if it were, when this is all said and done the moronic politicians and box ticking rank and file bureaucrats would be burnt at the stake, but this is not a just world and this is now probably on a special branch file.

fear52,CoronavirusUK,"Advice for UK university students: Closures, exams, etc.",3/6/2020 16:47,"I'm a lecturer/researcher at a large UK university. I've noticed that a lot of uni students have [questions and concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fe0677/can_you_please_sign_this_petition_as_students_it/) about university closures, exams, etc. Also, I've been shocked by [how badly some universities have communicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fe0a4a/petitition_around_cluster_at_kings_college_london/) with their staff and students. Here, I'll share what I know from the staff side of things (though things at your uni may differ) - I don't think hiding information from students is helpful.

* **Outright closures:** It is unlikely that your university will close outright without being told to do so by the government, but, by all means write to your university management questioning this if you feel concerned. You may also ask your lecturers to sign your letter, if you are a group of students. There are two online petitions I am aware of now, [one UK-wide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fe0677/can_you_please_sign_this_petition_as_students_it/) and one at [King's College London](https://www.change.org/p/senior-officers-at-king-s-college-london-king-s-college-london-community-has-coronavirus-and-needs-to-stop-classes).
* **Lectures:** Some people are worried about going to lectures, since they are rooms with large groups of people. First, if you have to go, **practise good basic hygeine** (wash your hands before and after, cough/sneeze into your elbow or a tissue which you then throw away, don't breathe in random people's faces). Second, **don't get upset with your lecturer**: **it's not their decision** whether lectures take place or not and they are likely also worried about their, your & their family's health (I know I am). You might try getting a group of students together and **asking your lecturer if they would consider online lectures**. I know I would do that if I could (but I'm in a laid back Faculty and have small lecture sizes compared to colleagues). If that's not possible, **ask if your lecturer could remind students about hygeine at the start/end of each lecture.** Keep in mind that [**74 UK universities are currently on strike anyway**](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10621/UCU-announces-14-strike-days-at-74-UK-universities-in-February-and-March?fbclid=IwAR3v1GqIYEDb6PDn8FBeLVoZugwmsreDDr7l2r2u8wBEwkhKOeWoTg4SHeI), so your lectures next week may not be taking place at all!
* **Exams:** Universities are making contingency plans for exams, including **postponement** or even **taking them remotely** (Edit: see comment below by u/FlipDetector). My personal feeling is that everyone is waiting to see how things develop before making any decisions, but rest assured that there are measures in place and those should definitely be communciated to you as soon as a decision is made.
* **Mitigation measures:** Our university is installing hand sanitizing stations in most buildings and asking students and staff to use these as they leave and enter buildings. Combined with proper coughing/sneezing etiquette (in an elbow or in a tissue and then thrown away) and not breathing in people's faces, this is seen as a good strategy to mitigate transmission.
* **Conferences and travel:** Right now, I haven't heard any official recommendations for cancelling conferences. Some laboratories have been told to limit all non-essential travel since at least last week.
* **Self-isolation and halls of residence:** If you live in university-managed accommodation (check this, since a lot of this has been sold off), your university probably has drawn up a plan for students who need to self-isolate which can then be extended to whole flats/blocks, etc. I've no idea what this would involve at other unis, but here our plan includes having designated flats which are currently empty and where ill students could be accommodated and have food and other supplies delivered daily. If you live in privately-owned/-managed halls, I think you should feel empowered to ask what their plan is, if they have one.
* **Laboratories:** Depending on size and national importance, laboratories may have a designated team of people who will have to go in during a crisis and take care of essential maintenance and upkeep (working on crucial science if told to do so, shutting down experiments, feeding animals, etc.).
* **International students:** If your visa is running out and you can't return home, the university should help you with this.

fdtjnb,CoronavirusUK,What I have learned about this.,3/5/2020 18:50,"For anyone who is relatively new to this. 

I have been following this since the first outbreak. For some reason I saw this immediately as a threat. I’ve never worried about any other outbreak before. But this is what you need to know. 

This is extremely contagious. You can get this by literally walking into someone’s fart in the veg aisle at Tesco’s. And yes I’m not kidding. It has an r0 of around 5. Which means for every one person who gets it they spread it to about 5 people. 

You can catch this by someone breathing on you.  By touching money. From your clothes if someone has sneezed or coughed near you and the wind blown it on you. Being in a public toilet where someone has been. Up to two hours previously. 

It’s not just the flu. 1 in five who contract this will need hospital treatment. It depletes oxygen so you will need supplemented oxygen and in some cases a vit c boost. And it can leave permanent damage. 

The CFR or mortality rate is 3.4%. I’m sorry to say I expect this to rise. 

It incubates and you can be contagious. I’m sorry to say any one of us could have this and not have a clue. You can have the virus for up to 21 days. (Extreme cases) or a week or two and be spreading it. As could anyone else. This is the part that means this is unstoppable right now. 

Vit c. Magnesium. Zinc. Vit d. All good supplements to take. And can help the body fight off the nasties.  Our bodies do have some defences. Likely we will all breath these little critters in at some point. But not everyone will contract it.  The better equipped our bodies are the better we can get rid of it. These are not cures they just help. 

If someone in your home is isolated. I’m sorry to say the chances of them spreading in your house is very high. The only way is to tape the door around the edges. And have a vent fitted to the room. Just look at hospital isolation wards 

It effects only old people with underlying problems.  This is true to an extent. But this is information that is sketchy in my opinion as so many young doctors in China have succumbed. So take this information with caution. Just because you are 17 doesn’t mean you won’t potentially have issues. 

Children don’t seem to suffer that bad. This is true it seems. But there are exceptions. But for the main part your kids appear to be pretty safe. However they are little monsters that spread it everywhere. 

Masks do work. P3 P2 N95 N99 N100 (couple others I can’t recall) do work. Dental and surgical masks also have some effect. Anything around your mouth and nose will have some effect. If you don’t want to wear a mask right now. Wear a snood. Better than nothing. 

Don’t forget to buy. Latex gloves and eye masks. At some point I expect there will be people wearing all these on the tube 

When you get home take your jacket and shoes off at the door and spray them both with anti germ stuff. Obviously don’t bleach your jacket. But start now as this will be the norm soon. Festival ponchos can be just thrown away. But these are a good idea to get. I’ve got a few coming. 

When it gets really bad you may want to take clothes off at the door and dunk them in a bucket. Change into house gear.  

This is coming. You will need to isolate for a while at some point. And you will know people who contract this. This is now a certainty. Just do what you can to do to prevent it getting to you. And don’t panic. Just prepare. Do what you should and you will be fine.  

Warm weather may kill this off.  It only may kill it. We may not have warm enough summers. But right now no one can say for sure. 

Sorry if you already know this. Sorry if it scares anyone that’s not my intention but we all deserve to know what’s we’re dealing with.",39,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fdtjnb/what_i_have_learned_about_this/

fiu2nb,CoronavirusUK,How to survive this epidemic,3/15/2020 10:11,"I'm assuming most people here are very aware of the ""herd immunity"" plan by the government and its consequences. In short the plan is that:

1. Majority of the population will get infected over the course of upcoming months
2. Most likely hundreds of thousands of people will die on an unprecedented scale that's compared to a major war or cataclysm. 

So what could be the consequences of this? 

1. Anarchy and public disorders - when the public realizes that people with serious life threatening conditions or people infected with coronavius with severe symptoms cannot get treated 
2. Disruptions to NHS and other public services like Police as they get infected as well.
3. Potential shortages of food and other supplies as workers get infected
4. Collapsing businesses that rely on hospitality or tourism & large potion of the population could be off work for months, what about people without any savings?
5. Pound sinking below euro or even worse due to economy collapsing & immigrants leaving/trying to leave the country 

It's astonishing to me how most of the UK's population aren't aware/care about the impending catastrophe even when Boris says straight up on national television ""People will die"". 

The question how can you prepare for this to minimize the risk for yourself and survive this crisis, I don't this stocking on toilet paper is going to help in any way here.

Any ideas/input?",36,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fiu2nb/how_to_survive_this_epidemic/
fi8uuh,CoronavirusUK,Scottish Government covering up confirmed cases.,3/14/2020 7:15,"Up in the Shetland islands, we’ve now become one of the areas most affected. It’s been a nightmare. This is from our local news: 


“The Scottish Government said on Friday afternoon that the number of confirmed cases had remained unchanged at six, a statement that was immediately challenged by local people.

NHS Shetland quickly corrected the figures upwards to eleven making Shetland one of the worst affected areas in Scotland by population, if not the whole of the UK.

However, the health board then found itself to be at odds with the Scottish Government policies and was instructed to recall its earlier statement and revert the figure of confirmed cases back to six.

To be clear, there are eleven confirmed cases of coronavirus in Shetland, but the political figure at the moment is six.”",39,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fi8uuh/scottish_government_covering_up_confirmed_cases/
fi2pt0,CoronavirusUK,A Swiss epidemiologist was asked what they think of the UK governments plan on /r/coronavirus,3/14/2020 0:51,"""Personally I am sceptical of this plan. I agree that we cannot 'stop' this virus now - it will be spreading in the population for a while (there will be many undetected cases circulating in the UK already, right now). That means that we **will** build up some level of immunity as a population.

The problem with herd immunity is that you need a \*lot\* of people to have it before its effective. That means openly deciding that you will allow a really large proportion of the population to get it - like 70% or more (usually you need more). You might say, ok just the young people get it, and the 30% is everyone over age XX. However, we know this virus \*does\* kill young people - even healthy ones.

So, if you let this virus infect every person under 65... and assume a fairly low estimate of CFR of 0.1% - what do the numbers tell you for the numbers dead? And this assumes we perfectly isolate all those over 65 - which is pretty difficult. (And what about those who have other conditions that make them vulnerable?)

I think the idea that we know enough about the virus to so carefully and preceicly control its spread in a way that would lead to this plan being successful is arrogant. We do not know the virus that well, and we cannot control spread so exactly.

However, I think we can seriously limit the spread and the speed of spread, by taking action now to limit social contacts and large groups, etc.""

fervqy,CoronavirusUK,Relationships During An Outbreak,3/7/2020 15:25,"Tonight I cried, properly cried, and its the first time I've cried in a long time.I was in bed with my partner of 7 years and I asked him if he was okay. He fobbed me off a bit and I just knew what was going on. I pressed him and asked if he was annoyed at me for talking about the virus so much. He told me ""I don't want the only thing you talk to me AT is the virus"". I didn't know what to say and even if I did I couldn't speak, I had a lump in my throat and spent the next several minutes in complete silence as I tried to stop the inevitable break.

There is only two people in my life that I truly feel if I lost I would lose myself too which would be my partner and my mum (even though I am forever at odds with hating and loving her). Both of them are at a severe risk of this and it absolutely sickens me when I see my peers scoffing at the news. They seem to feel the media is scaremongering when I feel the opposite, I feel like largely the media in this country is being selective on facts to hide how dangerous this is. They say ""only the elderly"" like the doesn't matter and ignore how many people fall into the vulnerable category due to existing conditions. I feel completely defeated.

I don't know how to end this post, but I want to ask all of you how this is effecting your relationships. I personally feel a new sense of tension and hopelessness. I know I won't be alone here, I'm not sure how much comfort that really brings me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I want to add that my boyfriend absolutely is taking it seriously but understandably because he is so high risk I think he would rather just keep it out of mind and try not to worry about it. He is taking as much precaution as he can with hand sanitiser etc and is considering buying nitrile gloves. Its going to be hard for him to not get this due to his office. No one has a personal computer/desk, they are instead given rooms and desks at more or less random so he has been cleaning down the keyboard and mouse when he gets there as he has no idea who touched it before. He can't take time off as he will not get sick pay due to a 'self employed' loophole. We didn't argue but I did bubble over, but we talked about it and agreed we've done what we can for now and will continue to be vigilant. All we can do for the foreseeable future is wait.

fevst3,CoronavirusUK,Direct response you have received from doctors and NHS 111,3/7/2020 22:27,"We have had an interesting experience reporting symptoms to our doctor and NHS 111, and wondered what the response has been for anyone else here that has gone through the process.

A quick summary of our experience: there has been a confirmed case in our area, and our children go to school with many from that village and also has pupils that have been abroad to affected areas.

My husband and I both had a cold, then began to exhibit flu like symptoms, and now shortness of breath, tight chest, joint weakness, headache, low HR etc. Husband spoke to 111, considering close contact with those who had travelled and not immediately self isolated, and the community case nearby.

(111 initially lead him off down a dead end in their call system and he was told to ring again and select a particular series of options.) Then spoke to a medical professional who went through an extensive set of questions (took about 40 mins) who was concerned about several symptoms mentioned above in particular. He was told to self-isolate, as was I (similar symptoms but not as severe - I am younger and not a smoker). Advised to speak to our GP to arrange where to get a tested/proper diagnosis.

This is where it went off the rails. Spoke to the GP. Went through a much shorter series of questions. GP said the following:
""You may have it, you may not.""
""They aren't testing anymore, it's already out in the community.""
""Those numbers don't mean anything."" (Referring to official case numbers released.)
""If you have it, good for you, it's better to have it early before there are too many cases to treat in  hospital.""
""No, you don't need to self-isolate, just stay away from immune compromised or older people."" (Errr, secondary contacts?)
""Yes your children can go into school."" (????!!!!)

The GP seemed almost disinterested. That or perhaps resigned, we don't know. If everything he said is true, that is very concerning. The fact that we already have deaths (sincerely, RIP) in the country indicates that it has already been circulating for several weeks/a month according to Dr John Campbell.

We may just have some other virus, either way we are self isolating. Thankfully the school are happy for us to keep the children at home as they wouldn't want them in with flu anyway. (They are showing mild symptoms.)

We are monitoring our own health carefully and will contact the NHS again if any of us get substantially worse. (As advised by 111.)

The most obvious thoughts are that no matter how much money is given to the NHS, they'll need added help, as in people. I look at a picture of Red Cross volunteers in the 1918 influenza pandemic on a newspaper site and wonder why there isn't anything in the article about gathering a volunteer army (since more than one expert has called it a war) to help fight the battle, or even if that's something that's suitable for this situation.

I've just applied for the Royal Voluntary Service and I've got email addresses for British Red Cross and NHS volunteering. I'd really like to hear though from others who are thinking the same way, or people who work for the NHS or other health services or charities about what and who they might need, and how anyone who wants to help can - even if it's helping clean and disinfect or organise supply cupboards or file paperwork - anything. 

I don't have any nursing training but I'm fit and healthy, a 'young' late-40s person, no children, parents passed away, used to care situations over the past decade with my mother, and I'm available. Seems like this is exactly the time when working together (as much as possible, with Mitchell and Webb's Remain Indoors sketch in mind), contributing to the community, added compassion, kindness and basically anything that's of practical and emotional use are needed more than ever. 

Anyone can only do what they can - it's not a judgment on anyone else's actions or views on this situation - I'd just like to know what anyone else thinks or knows.

What we need to do IMHO. Start proactively thinking how I can make things better. Maybe for a neighbour who may struggle with kids, age, illness etc and instead of filling your own cupboards up and creating panic for the media to make money off, consider how we can benefit society in its tough times. Come together as a community, don’t be terrified of the community. It’s awful, but this is this is not The Walking Dead. 

Don’t fixate on the numbers. I mean, what is the point? You are forcing your mind into fight or flight mode and even if you can handle it, maybe somebody reading it can’t. We are going to have suicides due to this. Ffs don’t be a factor pushing somebody who struggling past the point of no return. 

I realise releasing terror on here may be a defence mechanism and that’s cool too. Deep breaths (not within a metre of anyone else obvs! ;)

I’m going to post thus as a main thread actually and watch the downvotes role in. 

This sub needs to better. It is a harrowing time and maybe the government could be doing better but Feck me two extra bags of pasta isn’t going to change things for the better. What will is looking after each other. 

And maybe at the end of it we all have better hygiene and some new friends, and stronger communities - ready for the next one in about 11 years if the average is to be believed.

I am **not** a Macron fan *at all*. But this was a *huge* contrast from the bumbling, shifty-eyed talk Boris gave earlier and (according to my impressions) well-received by the French, despite Macron's lack of political popularity. What stood out for me in contrast with Boris was Macron's confident, combative language and demeanour. I found it stirring and rousing: he was frank about the difficulties ahead in France, Europe and across the world, emphasising that it would take a huge co-operation across the country, continent and globe from the level of governments to individuals.

fhdcrk,CoronavirusUK,The prediction thread for today,3/12/2020 16:55,"What are your predictions for today's figures for UK Confirmed Cases?

Yesterday the figure was 456, an increase of 83 from the day before or 22% growth.

The average prediction on [r/coronavirusuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusuk/) yesterday was 454, with a median of 440, so as a community we nailed it, well done, handshakes all round.

Average growth over the last few days has been 23% which would suggest a figure of 560 today (by contrast, Italy were averaging 40% at this stage). If we're still in a linear phase then average growth has been 59 new cases per day, so it would be 515 total, although if its still in a linear growth phase we are witnessing a UK miracle.

Other countries, when they were in a similar position had next day figures ranging from a low of 602 (USA) to a max of 735 (Spain) so its quite a spread. [Here's a graph showing the range](https://i.imgur.com/KZg8GZ9.png). For comparable European countries Germany was 620, Italy 667 and France 674. More internationally China was 609, South Korea 636 and Iran 720.

No other country has avoided going over 600 cases at this point.

Today might be the day that we overtake Japan, they've had the greatest control over this virus. We can no longer predict our data using theirs.

The past few days' UK growth was more favourable than any other European country's performance. [Here's a graph comparing the UK's growth to other nations since 206 cases](https://i.imgur.com/dXmLE13.png) (and [again with log scale](https://i.imgur.com/ZiK51yJ.png)). Maybe the UK's winning trend can go on forever, or the correction starts today.

I predict the figure for today will be 650, an increase of 194 new cases, 42% rise.

fgdihs,CoronavirusUK,How can I get through to UK family + friends? (based in South Korea),3/10/2020 21:06,"I posted here the other day some may remember, I am currently living and working in the Republic of Korea. I have witnessed the coronavirus crisis explode, and the lengths to which the government, the health service, and most importantly the public as a whole have gone to, in order to contain the virus. Thankfully, it seems that Korea is winning this battle.

People in the UK seem to blissfully naive about what is about to hit them. It scares me because I get messages from my Mum saying things like ""now Boris Johnson is saying we should stay home from work, if we just have the sniffles! How ridiculous!"" Meanwhile in Korea, I have been tested for coronavirus and yet STILL have not been at work for 2 weeks because it's been closed. I'm nowhere near the epicentre of the outbreak either. 

My girlfriend is still in the UK and is going to a major conference tomorrow. Why is a conference even still happening? It's mad, but it seems as though people in the UK are more worried about an Italian style lockdown, than the mass deaths that have hit Italy. Perhaps it's just a case of thinking it will always be 'someone else' who loses a friend or family member, because society didn't bother to work from home, didn't bother to change any habits, etc. 

There is a huge attitudinal problem, and like in Italy this disconnect from the looming danger could be the difference between handling it well or disaster. The whole ""keep calm carry on"" thing keeps getting repeated. It does my head in. This poster was a contingency poster for if the Nazis invaded Britain successfully, and we had surrendered to them. It is treated as an icon of British stoicism, when actually it should be seen as a warning of how close we have come to absolute calamity in living memory, and how unsure the outcomes of major world events can actually be. ""We made it through the war, we can make it through this."" 1 million Britons did not make it through the war. This is not a comparison we should want to be making. 

How do you get people to take it seriously? What I've seen in Korea is an incredible effort against coronavirus, it seems to have worked but I really doubt many other countries could pull this off. How can you convey to comfy people in Britain, as the virus is about to explode there, that they need to take extreme precautions now because in a few weeks time, it will be too late?",33,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fgdihs/how_can_i_get_through_to_uk_family_friends_based/

ffigev,CoronavirusUK,My thoughts as a teacher...,3/9/2020 4:21,"I'm concerned that the reason why schools haven't/won't shut is:

1) Parents/government and accountability when it comes to exam results, which won't help with students' mental health. The only way I can see any leniency is if the government shut all schools, rather than just in a certain area, and the exam boards make a very clear statement about compensation for exams in terms of requirements. 

2) Not seeing children and young people as risks for transmission, or caring that teachers/staff are at risk (as well as family members of both)

3) The government is worried about  a 'purge' where children/young people are home all day. Given the higher rates of gang violence and youth crime in the summer holidays, I don't think the government is keen to have to deal with a spike in youth crime on top of trying to maintain calm otherwise.",35,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/ffigev/my_thoughts_as_a_teacher/

fksvqd,CoronavirusUK,Live updates from the Press Briefing,3/19/2020 1:00,"You can watch it live [on Sky News’ livestream on YouTube](https://youtu.be/9Auq9mYxFEE).

We will expect to hear from 
- Boris Johnson, Prime Minister
- Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor
- ~~Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer~~ (sick leave?)
- Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is also due to appear to hopefully address the school situation.

I’ll update live for anyone unable to watch.

**17:00** The briefing will commence shortly.

**17:07** They are running a little late, which sums up the actions so far.

**17:17** They are running even more late. Also, the briefing still hasn't started yet.

**17:20** Gavin Williamson announces that schools are closing from Friday. It was announced earlier today that schools in Scotland and Wales are also closing from this coming Friday (20 March).

**17:21** The ~~devils rejects~~ panel have emerged.

**17:24** PM says schools will remain closed until further notice from Friday afternoon.

**17:26** Public and Private Schools, Nurseries to make provisions for children of *Key Workers*. There will be no exams in May and June.

**17:28** PM claims that the current measures are already slowing the spread.

**17:33** PM ~~has a laugh~~ says people are making *heroic efforts* to comply with guidance already, and will keep further measures under review.

**17:36** PM unable to give an indication on the duration of measures.

**17:39** PM says exam qualifications will not be impeded by the closures, but does not want to go into details.

**17:40** Vallance and Harries say testing will continue to be limited to people in hospital and NHS staff for the time being, but are *ambitous* to make home tests available.

**17:43** PM says legislation will be brought forward to protect renters from no-fault evictions, as mentioned during todays PMQ.

**17:46** PM clarifies that children of *key workers* will continue going to school, even after this Friday.

**17:47** PM doesn't comment on extending Brexit transition period.

**17:48** PM won't rule out lockdown, but it isn't happening now.

**17:49** Vallance stresses how important it is for us all to adhere to the guidance. PM won't enforce it, however, because he is *a believer in freedom*.

**17:50** The briefing is now over.

**TL;DR**

- schools are closed, sort of.

- you can still do as you please, but shouldn’t 

- the economic consequences that individuals are facing were not addressed but Boris ~~has a hard on~~ seems open minded about giving billions to *good companies*",34,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fksvqd/live_updates_from_the_press_briefing/

fii1va,CoronavirusUK,Are you thinking about your elderly or at risk neighbours? Will they need your help?,3/14/2020 21:04,"Where I live there are quite a few elderly neighbours. Some do not have family nearby. Is there anything you can do to help?

Here are a few ideas:

1) Make sure they have your phone number in case they need help. Get their phone number too.

2) offer to get shopping and leave at outside their door. Phone them to tell them you have a delivery.

3) keep in contact. They will feel lonely and will worry. A phone call not only tells you how they are, it also helps to keep everyone's sanity.

4) If they are not thinking of stocking up on food, grab a few extra tins of food for them. Even if you keep it at home at the moment it might be a life saver for them when they announce a lockdown.

5) check if they have animals and if they need food etc for them. If they are an animal person this will weight heavy on their minds.

6) check if they need medications. Help if you can by suggesting they stock up now.

7) listen to them. Many of the elderly grew up during war/rationing etc. They have a lot of info we all could use. 

Can you think of anything else that should be listed?

Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick.""

I rely on 2 trains (London trains) to commute to work every day and do not have a drivers license or car. I don't have anyone who can drive me 1 hour commute to the office in the morning and back home. I also am really unwell with the conditions mentioned above including being a chronic asthmatic. 
I contacted my manager today to explain the new advice from The WHO in light of the recent community transmission at 35 UK cases and asked if I can work from home (my company have put arrangements in place for us to use laptops and work from home in the event of an outbreak) but my manager is now asking me to come in tomorrow to discuss the situation. To me, that seems silly and very stupid to do considering ,The W.H.O' recent advice today. I'm thinking of  insisting on working from home tomorrow and calling HR to tell them I'll be following official advice?

The UK government’s decision to stop direct flights to west Africa because of the Ebola virus epidemic *was not based on science*, MPs have said, arguing that flights should be restored immediately.

A report by the Public Accounts Committee into the Department for International Development’s handling of the Ebola outbreak said that *“political decisions” had hampered the response to the epidemic.*1 The report stated, “The revocation of licences to carriers to fly direct to the region was a political decision with no basis in science and was inconsistent with World Health Organization advice.”

It went on to say that the department has since recognised that this decision caused inconvenience, adding, “In our judgment, it will inevitably have led to an increase in the costs of dealing with the outbreak and, potentially, to further loss of life.”

MPs criticised the department, as a major donor to WHO, for failing to ensure that the international community acted quickly in response to the outbreak. The department’s chief scientific officer, *Chris Whitty, admitted in evidence to the committee in December that the department “could and should have listened to and responded to the views of Médecins Sans Frontières and others on the ground who were warning of the seriousness of the outbreak.”*

I am a lead pencil — the ordinary wooden pencil familiar to all boys and girls and adults who can read and write.

Writing is both my vocation and my avocation; that's all I do.

You may wonder why I should write a genealogy. Well, to begin with, my story is interesting. And, next, I am a mystery — more so than a tree or a sunset or even a flash of lightning. But, sadly, I am taken for granted by those who use me, as if I were a mere incident and without background. This supercilious attitude relegates me to the level of the commonplace. This is a species of the grievous error in which mankind cannot too long persist without peril. For, the wise G.K. Chesterton observed, ""We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders.""

I, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe, a claim I shall attempt to prove. In fact, if you can understand me — no, that's too much to ask of anyone — if you can become aware of the miraculousness that I symbolize, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing. I have a profound lesson to teach. And I can teach this lesson better than can an automobile or an airplane or a mechanical dishwasher because — well, because I am seemingly so simple.

Simple? Yet, not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me. This sounds fantastic, doesn't it? Especially when it is realized that there are about one and one-half billion of my kind produced in the United States each year.

Pick me up and look me over. What do you see? Not much meets the eye — there's some wood, lacquer, the printed labeling, graphite lead, a bit of metal, and an eraser.

#### Innumerable Antecedents

Just as you cannot trace your family tree back very far, so is it impossible for me to name and explain all my antecedents. But I would like to suggest enough of them to impress upon you the richness and complexity of my background.

My family tree begins with what in fact is a tree, a cedar of straight grain that grows in Northern California and Oregon. Now contemplate all the saws and trucks and rope and the countless other gear used in harvesting and carting the cedar logs to the railroad siding. Think of all the persons and the numberless skills that went into their fabrication: the mining of ore, the making of steel and its refinement into saws, axes, motors; the growing of hemp and bringing it through all the stages to heavy and strong rope; the logging camps with their beds and mess halls, the cookery and the raising of all the foods. Why, untold thousands of persons had a hand in every cup of coffee the loggers drink!

The logs are shipped to a mill in San Leandro, California. Can you imagine the individuals who make flat cars and rails and railroad engines and who construct and install the communication systems incidental thereto? These legions are among my antecedents.

Consider the millwork in San Leandro. The cedar logs are cut into small, pencil-length slats less than one-fourth of an inch in thickness. These are kiln dried and then tinted for the same reason women put rouge on their faces. People prefer that I look pretty, not a pallid white. The slats are waxed and kiln dried again. How many skills went into the making of the tint and the kilns, into supplying the heat, the light and power, the belts, motors, and all the other things a mill requires? Sweepers in the mill among my ancestors? Yes, and included are the men who poured the concrete for the dam of a Pacific Gas & Electric Company hydroplant, which supplies the mill's power!

Don't overlook the ancestors present and distant who have a hand in transporting 60 carloads of slats across the nation.

Once in the pencil factory — $4,000,000 in machinery and building, all capital accumulated by thrifty and saving parents of mine — each slat is given eight grooves by a complex machine, after which another machine lays leads in every other slat, applies glue, and places another slat atop — a lead sandwich, so to speak. Seven brothers and I are mechanically carved from this ""wood-clinched"" sandwich.

My ""lead"" itself — it contains no lead at all — is complex. The graphite is mined in [Ceylon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceylon). Consider these miners and those who make their many tools and the makers of the paper sacks in which the graphite is shipped and those who make the string that ties the sacks and those who put them aboard ships and those who make the ships. Even the lighthouse keepers along the way assisted in my birth — and the harbor pilots.

The graphite is mixed with clay from Mississippi in which ammonium hydroxide is used in the refining process. Then wetting agents are added such as sulfonated tallow — animal fats chemically reacted with sulfuric acid. After passing through numerous machines, the mixture finally appears as endless extrusions — as from a sausage grinder — cut to size, dried, and baked for several hours at 1,850 degrees Fahrenheit. To increase their strength and smoothness the leads are then treated with a hot mixture that includes candelilla wax from Mexico, paraffin wax, and hydrogenated natural fats.

My cedar receives six coats of lacquer. Do you know all the ingredients of lacquer? Who would think that the growers of castor beans and the refiners of castor oil are a part of it? They are. Why, even the processes by which the lacquer is made a beautiful yellow involve the skills of more persons than one can enumerate!

Observe the labeling. That's a film formed by applying heat to carbon black mixed with resins. How do you make resins and what, pray, is carbon black?

My bit of metal — the ferrule — is brass. Think of all the persons who mine zinc and copper and those who have the skills to make shiny sheet brass from these products of nature. Those black rings on my ferrule are black nickel. What is black nickel and how is it applied? The complete story of why the center of my ferrule has no black nickel on it would take pages to explain.

Then there's my crowning glory, inelegantly referred to in the trade as ""the plug,"" the part man uses to erase the errors he makes with me. An ingredient called ""factice"" is what does the erasing. It is a rubberlike product made by reacting rapeseed oil from the [Dutch East Indies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies) with sulfur chloride. Rubber, contrary to the common notion, is only for binding purposes. Then, too, there are numerous vulcanizing and accelerating agents. The pumice comes from Italy; and the pigment that gives ""the plug"" its color is cadmium sulfide.

#### No One Knows

Does anyone wish to challenge my earlier assertion that no single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me?

Actually, millions of human beings have had a hand in my creation, no one of whom even knows more than a very few of the others. Now, you may say that I go too far in relating the picker of a coffee berry in far-off Brazil and food growers elsewhere to my creation; that this is an extreme position. I shall stand by my claim. There isn't a single person in all these millions, including the president of the pencil company, who contributes more than a tiny, infinitesimal bit of know-how. From the standpoint of know-how the only difference between the miner of graphite in Ceylon and the logger in Oregon is in the type of know-how. Neither the miner nor the logger can be dispensed with, any more than can the chemist at the factory or the worker in the oil field — paraffin being a byproduct of petroleum.

Here is an astounding fact: neither the worker in the oil field nor the chemist nor the digger of graphite or clay nor any who mans or makes the ships or trains or trucks nor the one who runs the machine that does the knurling on my bit of metal nor the president of the company performs his singular task because he wants me. Each one wants me less, perhaps, than does a child in the first grade. Indeed, there are some among this vast multitude who never saw a pencil nor would they know how to use one. Their motivation is other than me. Perhaps it is something like this: each of these millions sees that he can thus exchange his tiny know-how for the goods and services he needs or wants. I may or may not be among these items.

#### No Mastermind

There is a fact still more astounding: the absence of a mastermind, of anyone dictating or forcibly directing these countless actions which bring me into being. No trace of such a person can be found. Instead, we find the Invisible Hand at work. This is the mystery to which I earlier referred.

It has been said that ""only God can make a tree."" Why do we agree with this? Isn't it because we realize that we ourselves could not make one? Indeed, can we even describe a tree? We cannot, except in superficial terms. We can say, for instance, that a certain molecular configuration manifests itself as a tree. But what mind is there among men that could even record, let alone direct, the constant changes in molecules that transpire in the life span of a tree? Such a feat is utterly unthinkable!

I, Pencil, am a complex combination of miracles: a tree, zinc, copper, graphite, and so on. But to these miracles that manifest themselves in nature an even-more-extraordinary miracle has been added: the configuration of creative human energies — millions of tiny know-hows configurating naturally and spontaneously in response to human necessity and desire and in the absence of any human masterminding! Since only God can make a tree, I insist that only God could make me. Man can no more direct these millions of know-hows to bring me into being than he can put molecules together to create a tree.

The above is what I meant when writing, ""If you can become aware of the miraculousness that I symbolize, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing."" For, if one is aware that these know-hows will naturally, yes, automatically, arrange themselves into creative and productive patterns in response to human necessity and demand — that is, in the absence of governmental or any other coercive masterminding — then one will possess an absolutely essential ingredient for freedom: a faith in free people. Freedom is impossible without this faith.

Once government has had a monopoly of a creative activity such, for instance, as the delivery of the mails, most individuals will believe that the mails could not be efficiently delivered by men acting freely. And here is the reason: each one acknowledges that he himself doesn't know how to do all the things incident to mail delivery. He also recognizes that no other individual could do it. These assumptions are correct. No individual possesses enough know-how to perform a nation's mail delivery any more than any individual possesses enough know-how to make a pencil. Now, in the absence of faith in free people — in the unawareness that millions of tiny know-hows would naturally and miraculously form and cooperate to satisfy this necessity — the individual cannot help but reach the erroneous conclusion that mail can be delivered only by governmental ""masterminding.""

#### Testimony Galore

If I, Pencil, were the only item that could offer testimony on what men and women can accomplish when free to try, then those with little faith would have a fair case. However, there is testimony galore; it's all about us and on every hand. Mail delivery is exceedingly simple when compared, for instance, to the making of an automobile or a calculating machine or a grain combine or a milling machine or to tens of thousands of other things.

Delivery? Why, in this area where men have been left free to try, they deliver the human voice around the world in less than one second; they deliver an event visually and in motion to any person's home when it is happening; they deliver 150 passengers from Seattle to Baltimore in less than four hours; they deliver gas from Texas to one's range or furnace in New York at unbelievably low rates and without subsidy; they deliver each four pounds of oil from the Persian Gulf to our Eastern Seaboard — halfway around the world — for less money than the government charges for delivering a one-ounce letter across the street!

The lesson I have to teach is this: Leave all creative energies uninhibited. Merely organize society to act in harmony with this lesson. Let society's legal apparatus remove all obstacles the best it can. Permit these creative know-hows freely to flow. Have faith that free men and women will respond to the Invisible Hand. This faith will be confirmed. I, Pencil, seemingly simple though I am, offer the miracle of my creation as testimony that this is a practical faith, as practical as the sun, the rain, a cedar tree, the good earth.

## Key points:

• Early stages of a local pandemic - containment has failed

• Hand washing, mask, isolation will slow the virus but not contain it.

• China numbers are bogus - only 5% of cases are being detected. Based on todays numbers that would mean the number of infected is actually around 840,000.

• Mortality rate much lower than the Wuhan rate (20%), perhaps around 1% is an uncertain estimate. True death rate in China would be at least 8,400.

• Beijing hospitals ‘full of pneumonia cases’ 

• In the UK only one in three cases are being detected; local transmission will begin in a few weeks

• 60% of population will be infected if community transmission takes hold; this could mean around 40million infected and 400,000 dead in UK

## Transcript

Interviewer: How well are we doing at detecting the virus?

I think case numbers are the tip of the iceberg, particularly in China where they are only detecting probably 5% of cases - the most severe - so i think it is misleading to look at the Chinese case numbers effectively they’re just looking at the epidemic in Hubei and Wuhan Provence. Outside that province they are only reporting cases that have a link to Wuhan since they sealed the city two weeks ago it is unsurprising that cases are going down.

I think were in the early phases of a global pandemic at the moment. Singapore is seeing local transmission. The fact hat we’ve only reported 8 cases in this country is just because again our surveillance is focussed on travellers. We think probably we’re picking up maybe **one in three cases** at the current time.

We will know more in the next few weeks when surveillance is started in hospitals across the UK of pneumonia cases. That will give us a proper picture. I think the sort of measures John Oxford talked about may have some potential to slow spread down and move us out of the flu season, release NHS pressures a bit, but i think it is highly unlikely that will stop transmission of this virus.

Interviewer: And when you talked about local transmission can you explain exactly what that means?

So at the moment we’ve been seeing cases, detecting cases, in travellers, they were infected overseas effectively. When we can be sure transmission has started here we’re getting transmission from person-to-person within the UK in a sustained manner - that’s what we mean by local transmission. 

Interviewer: And what about death rates from the disease?

So again the picture in China is somewhat misleading for a number of reasons. They are mostly hospitalising very severe cases and there is a three week delay frombasically when somebody gets ill to when they die, so you have to compare the deaths being seen now with cases three weeks ago so in Wuhan for instance, the cases they are detecting have a mortality of 20% but since that’s the tip of the iceberg the overall mortality rate we think is much lower but still potentially concerning maybe 1% of those getting infected might die but we have a lot of uncertainty around that estimate.

Interviewer: Is it possible to know when this might reach a peak?

So i think at the moment um our best eastimates are really that transmission will really get going in the UK in the next few weeks unless we’re very lucky probably peaking two or three months after that. It has to be bourne in mind the epidemic in Wuhan is peaking at the moment, it’s be going for 3 months since the beginning of December, we have no real idea what’s going on in the rest of China. Hospitals in Beijing apparently are full of pneumonia cases which are not being tested so we have no clear indication of true numbers in China. So that is a planning assumption in the UK. We would all of course like it to be less severe than we’re worrying about but policy has to plan for the worst case, or at least the reasonable worst case, which is what’s going on now. 

Interviewer: So what should they be planning for in terms of numbers getting the virus? 

If it truly establishes itself in terms of community person-to-person transmission, it will behave actually a lot like a flu pandemic. Maybe about 60% of the population getting infected, but most of those people will have very very mild symptoms.",26,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/f2po3j/transcript_of_radio_4_today_interview_with_prof/
fkpbbh,CoronavirusUK,Extra volunteers when times get tough?,3/18/2020 21:13,"Now, here me out, I am not some joe bloggs wanting to be a hero. 

As we all know, the NHS is already stretched to breaking point prior to the Covid19 outbreak, and as we all kow theyre already under intense pressure with the virus. Theres been talks of bringing retired doctors and nurses back to work and help out, as well as medical students.

&#x200B;

I have a proposition, and I wonder if you guys (the general public) would be able to say if you would be comfortable or not with this. 

Within the veterinary community theres been a lot of talks of us wanitng to help I am a qualified veterinary nurse. Theres a lot of talk witin us of wanting to help the NHS and help with short staffing should we need to. A lot for vet nurses and vets seem very keen to help.

We know a LOT about medicine (probably know the most about medicine after doctors and human nurses, we know a LOT about infectious control and disease prevention and control (as we work with infectious diseases that we can catch daily). Although legally would not feel comfortable or be allowed to do actual procedures (which is rightly so), we can do TPR (temp, pulse, respiration counts), blood pressure checks, first aid, and generalised TLC to human patients. I am not sure if it would ever get to this point, however, i consider this a possibility. I would be happy to step up to the mark if i had to, as we know more than the majority of the population when it comes to medicine. We understand body systems of multiple species, and in terms of mammals (humans/dogs cats) body systems are pretty much the same and work in the same way. 

&#x200B;

As the general public, would you guys feel comfortable being looked after or a relative being looked after (as long as youre not critically ill) by a vet or vet nurse? It would be a major help to the NHS staffing issues.

Comments on this would be good! Would love to hear your thoughts on this matter! Please remember to be respectful to my industry and the NHS! Thank you!",27,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fkpbbh/extra_volunteers_when_times_get_tough/

So it’s only one week ago many of us were starting to stock up. Some longer. And I’m sure many of us were told we were a bit crazy. 

Ok so there’s still a bit of time.  Many people still don’t know how bad this could get. A month ago I heard of supermarkets stocking up on dried foods. Powdered milk. Long life tins. So they have known this will happen. 

Some tips from an ex poor teenager. 

Pasta. Polenta. Cous cous. Rice. 

Cheap. Easy to store. Good calories. Versatile.   Get a good amount of this stuff. 

Tinned fish/ meat/ veg/ fruit/ evap milk

Tinned peaches will never have tasted so good two weeks into eating pasta. Trust me. They are cheap and have vit c.  Tinned stuff can be just as healthy as fresh. 

Frozen. 

If you have a massive freezer go for it. Bread will go v short. Chicken. Veg as much fresh stuff is imported at the mo. But for smaller freezers calorie dense foods rather than carrots and broccoli 

Flour baking stuff. 

Doesn’t matter if you’ve never cooked in your life. It’s cheap. You’ll use it last. Loads of uses. Lasts decent amount of time. Fresh bread will go short supply. Cocoa. Baking soda yeast. 

Snack bars. Etc. 

Get as many as you like but in quarantine these get nibbled so quick.  Same goes for chocolate. Hurricane preppers in Florida testify to that. 

UHT milk. Almond milk. Powdered milk 

Milk will go v short supply. Doesn’t matter if you don’t like long life stuff now. You’ll get used to it v v quick. 

Baked beans 

Cheap. A meal. Don’t knock em. Still plenty on shelves. 

Meds. 

If you are on prescription try and get more if possible.  

Get first aid kit. Hospitals will be a virus stronghold. 

I’m sure you’ll have your own ideas. But do not overlook the things you would not normally buy or eat because diet etc. I’m on Keto and I have pasta.  They are talking of bringing in the army and food riots. This is really really serious. I think you have to consider two or even three months worth of food if you can. We import so much food. And if everyone else is stocking up we will run short. And we will go on rations. This sort of thing is not said by governments Lightly. 

This is the time to act. I hope I’m wrong and I hope this is sensational headlines. But so far everything is going exactly as i thought it would go. 

Throw a sickly tomorrow if you have to. I’ve stocked up on some stuff and feels so much better. And I have a feeling we will be needing it.  Quarantines coming within two weeks.  Shortages of food within four maybe six. But you will see empty shelves.

But honestly I am freaking out and I don’t think anyone in the real world will understand why. It’s the last day of my parents’ cruise. Their ship is docked (on the other side of the world) but the port won’t let anyone leave due to ‘safety concerns’ related to the virus. I’ve had no updates other than a quick message from them saying they are fine and not to worry, but they may be late back to the UK.

They are high risk (older) and my father has long term health issues. I really really didn’t want them to go on this cruise but didn’t feel I could stop them. At the time there was little to no mainstream coverage of Coronavirus. I felt I was overreacting because I am a worrier by nature. They were very relaxed as they weren’t going anywhere near China (at the time there was minimal spread beyond that). 

I’ve spent a fortnight praying that we can just get them back home safely, and unable to share my fears because people will think I’m irrational. When I have expressed worries to people I’ve been met with polite bemusement and a bit of ribbing (which I don’t mind, just concerned my fears aren’t shared).

Now I don’t know when they are coming home, or whether they are at risk or infection at the moment. They are stuck in one of the worst possible environments for contagion. I feel very angry that this has all been downplayed by the kind of sources my parents might have taken seriously. 

Anyway excuse the rant I just needed to get this off my chest. I am still hopeful it will all be resolved. But I feel scared and resentful at the moment.

UPDATE: Just a quick update to add that after a very stressful few days, my parents ship was finally able to dock at an alternative destination and they arrived back in the UK today (by plane). There was no evidence of Covid-19 found onboard their ship. Your kind words and best wishes really helped me at the height of my stress and anxiety about this, which is why I wanted to let those of you who commented know there was a happy ending. They are in good spirits and I think still don’t really understand the seriousness of the current situation - which in a way is a good thing as it meant they weren’t panicking when it happened. My focus now is getting them to understand the reality they have come home to (without scaremongering) and ensure they are prepared and protected.

The supermarket I work for has set out guidelines but my managers are giving us different information - we've been told by head office to ask all customers if they are self-isolating but one of my colleagues got told off by my manager for doing just that. I've had a cold (definitely, no flu symptoms at all) for the last week, coughing fairly frequently, and not one manager has suggested I go home or shown any kind of concern at all. Two managers said to me that they were ill too  and just shrugged. Didnt feel like I'd get a good response from phoning in sick after that conversation and I don't want to lose my job.

We've not been told anything about what to do if we get sick, and the reason I haven't just phoned in is because I wouldn't get paid for the first few days (which I can't afford) and I've already had too many sick days and if I take more I'll get pulled into an investigation meeting.

I am freaking out because of the number of people I deliver to every day, elderly and disabled people, and not only am I concerned about giving them something but I am also concerned for my own health. All it will take is for one driver to get it and the entire department will go down. I'm frightened. I'm frightened because nobody higher up seems to care about the employees on the shop floor and in the delivery vans, besides sending 'good job team' emails. This whole thing is making me anxious and depressed and the numbers keep going up and up and up.

There's THOUSANDS of people looking at this on these forums, and only tens of officials/experts in the UK doing the same for the government.

Anyone can make a mistake, and perhaps those few experts in the UK working on this have fucked up the estimate?

""Wisdom of the crowds"" shows how a thousand people estimating the jelly beans in a jar averages out to an accurate count - is that in action in this situation?

This could mean the government goes sailing past the ""best"" lockdown timing, and we crash full force into Italy's situation 2 weeks before the government expected!

It appears steps to start quarantining schools and businesses will start on the 20th of March... from estimates on here that would be just as the NHS hits a surge crisis and is saturated. Just like Italy was.

fecjek,CoronavirusUK,"Basic numerical outcomes, or why we need to sort out where to treat people.",3/6/2020 20:06,"Based on Jeremy Hunt's 20% of the population figures, basic numerical outcomes


UK population :  67,773,038 source [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/)


20% infection : 13,554,608 people

Now we're not sure on exact breakdown of mild cases/requiring hospitisation/fatalities yet as it's developing situation so looking at a few scenarios.

Mild cases 80%, hospitilisation 20%, Fatal 3.4% 
Would see:


* Mild/ at home:  10,843,686 cases


* Requiring hospital : 2,710,922


* Fatalities: 460,857
 

Hospital beds in UK: 167,600 
source [statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/473264/number-of-hospital-beds-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/)


So 2,543,322 more people requiring hospitilisation than available beds (I know in practice all beds wouldn't be used for Covid-19 cases), which is pretty stark.

On a much more conservitive estimate with 10% requiring hospitilisation and 1% fatality we have:

* Requiring hospitalisation : 1,355,461

* Fatality: 135,546

Which is still 1,187,861 more people requiring hospitalisation than existing beds (never mind available beds).

This is obviously a vast oversimplification, but it's not an unrealistic scenario at this point.

Edit: according to /u/steveholter 's 15% day on day increase figures

https://imgur.com/a/EMGzB3F 15% day on day rise has hospitilisations passing 167,600 on day 80, (05/03/2020 being day 0 (115 cases)) with 20% of entire population infected on day 84. 

Assumptions :

* 20% hospitilisation rate

* 17 day hospital stay

And as many of us know there appears to be a 14 % re infection rate. And a number of reinfections. Which is pretty scary. And the second time around it smashed you to bits by all accounts. 

Hence those us us that have been following this are as confused as hell in this stance. 

So what do they know we don’t?  

Many of us are pretty sure where this came from. Let’s not get into that here, but I don’t need to go further. So the only thing that makes sense is they have data we just don’t have, right now. Because from everything I’ve seen this feels like we are about to hit big trouble hard.

fjkca6,CoronavirusUK,Creating a Database of Content for People in Quarantine,3/16/2020 20:42," Hi all,

My name is Will Tilbrook, I am a District Councillor on Arun District Council. Many of the constituents in the area I represent are either elderly or have underlying health problems and are likely to be under quarantine for a while.

As a younger person, there is a lot of content online that I would use to keep myself busy, such as youtube and podcasts. However, many older folks are either unaware of the variety of content online or do not feel confident technically. And many of these folks would be interested in some of this content despite limited exposure. For instance, there are plenty of guys I know in their 70s who are into military history who would love online strategy games.

This may not be the highest priority but it will make isolation easier for people, and therefore hopefully easier to maintain. 

I have been trying to create a central forum/database of content with brief descriptions and hyperlinks to the content. I am also working on explainers for how to use different services for people who have limited experience using them. These will be in word document and PDF form.

The reason I am posting on here is that I want to share the Google Sheets where I am collating the databases so people can add to the database as I only have knowledge of certain types of content and have limited time. So if you have a spare few minutes feel free to add to the following databases with content you enjoy-

fja26e,CoronavirusUK,We're all passengers in a racecar,3/16/2020 6:40,"Flattening the curve, building immunity in the resilient, protecting the vulnerable, the futility of suppression due to other places with weaker healthcare, all of those I can accept. The basic goals of the plan seem sound to me, and I think I can reasonably expect those in charge to not make errors in the details.

It's still uncomfortable to see the plan in action. In a motor racing analogy of the epidemic case curve, the horizontal line of healthcare capacity is a hard wall at the next corner. Braking is needed to reduce speed and corner safely. But as civilians we're all passengers in the car, and:

1. We can see China and Italy wrecked on the side of the track.
2. We haven't been told where the corner is, what the cornering speed will be, and when braking will start (the target capacity and when to implement controls).
3. We know the brakes need to be slammed on weeks before the corner is reached to reach the right speed (incubation period).
4. The accelerator is stuck on, we're already moving uncomfortably fast, and when the driver said he'll try to take the corner he actually reduced braking (reduction of isolation period).
5. While the driver is super good at computer simulations, nobody has ever approached this corner in real life and not crashed; some have stopped short and that option looks really attractive right about now.",24,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fja26e/were_all_passengers_in_a_racecar/

fijaso,CoronavirusUK,Point of View From The Classroom,3/14/2020 22:37,"I'm new to this sub and thought I'd offer a, perhaps, little explored PoV of the developing virus. Apologies in advance for any format issues as I'm in mobile.

I'm a teacher in a high school in a city with low income families and with a higher than average proportion of foreign nationalities in our city and in particular my school. 

Whether you agree or disagree with not closing the schools, I think a lot of people do not know what is actually happening in schools. 

We have not been provided hand gels for classes (unless teachers already had one), kids are not washing their hands more often, they are in such close confinement to hundreds of other kids throughout the day. The cleaning company who clean after school finishes do not get enough time per room (usually 5 minutes) to disinfect everything. Students are constantly fist bumping, grabbing hands, sharing pens, eating without washing hands first and just generally being kids. Which is of course not their fault! 

Even if the science shows that they're not as vulnerable to COVID-19 as adults and the elderly are, kids are great little incubators and carriers. 

In my opinion, we are not being supported by the government/council in any way. The only word we've had is to be ready and prep work for students if schools are to shut down. That is it. In my opinion, the schools are not ready for the coronavirus and will become breeding grounds for the virus. 

As for closing schools. I am on the fence. Some of the kids I teach would not get fed at some meal times, they would not be going home to happy homes or positive environments and school is their safe place. I feel sorry for them but at the same time, would it be safer to have them off school? But this then of course has massive knock on effects for parents/carers. It's a tough call to make. 

I'd be interested to hear other teachers or generally other people's opinions on how the situation in schools is being handled.

EDIT: I mentioned the type of city I am in as we have parents who struggle to provide food every day for their kids let alone being able to stock up on essentials. Also, we have kids who go to visit family members in other countries during half term and of course then come back to school.",23,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fijaso/point_of_view_from_the_classroom/
fi273b,CoronavirusUK,1st death in Scotland (Lothian health board) Older person with those underlying health conditions.,3/14/2020 0:19,,23,5,https://i.redd.it/g608jubstgm41.png
fi14vv,CoronavirusUK,A rant on the current strategy,3/13/2020 23:12,"copypasted from a comment on another thread which got way too long  


The thing is, we know what the plan is here. The expectation on behalf of the government is that most people will get this virus - perhaps up to 60% of the country, perhaps more. This means, with a death rate of 1%, that 420,000 will die. We know from Italy and Wuhan that when the healthcare system is overwhelmed, that death rate can go up, as \~5% of cases can need critical care to survive. In a worst case, if the peak isn't spread out, 20% of the country could be sick at once - also said by the CMO. This would mean 1.2 million needing hospital treatment and we have 1,000 ICU beds in the country. Needless to say, that 1.2 million would not all make it.

So in light of these facts, what is the plan? The plan is to wait an indeterminate amount of time - they won't say - to implement social distancing measures. The reason being that they expect the risk is that the population will initially enthusiastically self-isolate, and then people will get sick of it and start to go outside just as the risk gets higher, because coronavirus will be ""old news."" A full lockdown, they believe, would be unsustainable and could make things worse if a renewed outbreak is seen later in the year.

Now there are several reasons people are angry. One of these is that many people didn't realise that an outcome where many thousands of people die in the UK was likely, let alone ""part of the plan"". Another is that other governments are acting much sooner to lock things down to attempt to slow the spread of the virus, making us look slow, and they may well have fewer deaths in the near-term than we do.

I think it's very important to point out that ""science"" does not tell you exactly what to do in a given situation. Boris is hiding behind some veneer of ""science"" to shy away from the fact that he is making political decisions here. I'm a climate scientist. Science tells us flying emits greenhouse gases which cause climate change which has damaging effects. It doesn't tell us what to do about that. We could shoot down all the planes tomorrow, or we could decide that flying gives us other benefits that outweigh the environmental damage and carry on regardless. Not only that, scientists massively disagree with each other on many issues, not least what the best course of action is to take based on their scientific evidence - I know as many climate scientists with different opinions on the best methods to deal with climate change than I do climate scientists. That is a political judgement. You can get an awful lot of scientific evidence on precisely how bad flying is and precisely what would happen under climate change and what your alternative options are, but at the end of the day, a judgement is made that weighs up the pros and cons. So people are perfectly entitled to criticise Boris' judgement.  
Me personally? I'd criticise Johnson for several reasons.

First, we're still learning more about this virus. There are serology tests ongoing in Wuhan which will tell us precisely what proportion of the population were infected in that initial outbreak. If there are a lot of asymptomatic cases or cases with mild symptoms, then it might turn out that the death rate is lower than we currently think. If not, it will be higher, and your cost benefit analysis suddenly changes as to  
how many lives might be lost. Although a vaccine is unlikely for a year or so, antiviral treatments are being tested on populations all the time, some of which are showing some promise. So a later outbreak might give us time to ramp up those treatments.

Second. The refusal to lockdown is ostensibly based on the notion that people will get bored with quarantine if you do it too early. Again I disagree here. Right now, we have as many cases as Wuhan did when Wuhan was locked down. Wuhan saw hospitals overwhelmed. I've been talking to a friend online who's been in Wuhan the entire time. Believe me, when that number of people are dying, you don't want to suddenly violate quarantine - you just want to be safe. It will be \*easier\* to enforce quarantine in a few weeks when the newspapers are full of stories of nurses and doctors - British nurses and doctors - dying in makeshift hospitals after 72-hour shifts. I don't want this to happen, but this is what is going to happen. So I think their behavioural modelling is wrong.

Third, and in my view most egregious. I don't see much evidence that we're treating this thing with the seriousness that it deserves. World War I killed 700,000 British soldiers. World War II killed around 450,000 Brits (70,000 of those civilians in bombing raids.) Yes, you can't fight a pandemic in the same way that you can fight a war, and yes, lots of people will argue that elderly and medically vulnerable people are less valuable than young soldiers. But the ultimate threat of this thing is that it will kill as many people as those huge seismic events.

The point of the policy is to try and delay so that we can build up capacity and spread that peak out so that fewer people die. Where is the evidence that any kind of capacity is being built up? Why are people who are old and immunosuppressed being urged ""not to go on cruises"" rather than being given governmental licence to stay at home? Where are the temporary hospitals that we're going to need being constructed? Where are the new respirators, ventilators, supplementary oxygen etc. being supplied? Where is the new service for assessing cases in order of severity to decide who gets treatment? Where is the PPE for nurses and doctors in the NHS? Those of us here aren't experts and yet we knew what the experts knew weeks ago - that a pandemic was likely and how many would be infected. Even Chris Whitty, the CMO, gave these figures two weeks ago in a UK press conference so believe me they knew even before we did and yet nothing at all has been done. I went into hospital earlier this week and gave them most of the masks I bought for myself and my family - as a young person I'll probably live this thing and it seemed stupid to keep them - and more patients had masks than staff. There are reports up and down the country of staff who are not being equipped properly to deal with this. The staff in A+E I gave the masks to were happy to receive them and they were in the process of putting up signs urging people with coronavirus not to come in and infect them - literally they said ""not that they listen anyway"" as I was approaching them. Unbeknownst to me, someone in that hospital was battling coronavirus and they died the day after I went in.

So yeah. The policy to delay and fiddle around with precise definitions of when to implement social distancing based on some fancy behavioural-economic-pandemic model may well end up being a pretty sound one. But there are reasons to be angry.",24,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fi14vv/a_rant_on_the_current_strategy/

fgw1n3,CoronavirusUK,"150 Deaths is the critical marker for ""28 Days Later""",3/11/2020 20:03,"My logic:

UK has contingency for 1000 high-dependency cases (25% of 4000 ""beds"", along with the rest of the kit and staff)

5% of those infected with this strain of coronavirus will need high-dependency to stand a chance of survival.

We have (based on Chinese data) a 1% death rate.  So, **of** those in high-dependency units, 1 in 5 will likely die, despite best efforts.  They are, and always were, the 1%.

Working backwards now; 200 deaths arises from 1000 occupants. Beds full. 
With a cautious projection of 15% day-on-day rise in actual infections, 200 is reached after two days following 150. (of course - there are now 200 free beds ...)

How many people infected does it take to get to 150 deaths? 150 is 1% of 15000.  

So far, testing in the UK has been sampling, rather than screening.  But, those tested positive are, duh, positive!

Using the cautious 15% day-on-day rise in actual infections,  the current 373 positive cases will exceed that threshold in 27 days.    ( 373×1.15^27  )

Here is a summary of today’s **lobby briefing**, as reported by our political correspondent Andrew Sparrow.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said:

* The UK is still in the contain phase, but it is accepted that the disease will spread at speed. Any steps to delay the disease have to be introduced at the optimum time.
* The government will be led by the evidence and scientific advice. If there is further advice, it will be issued. At the moment the advice is for people to wash their hands thoroughly.
* The government has been issuing advice to people returning from specific areas. Temperature checks on arrival are not effective and the government has an evidence-based, clinical approach to this.
* The number of cases in the UK is increasing, we have had the first fatalities and it is clear that it is spreading in the country.
* The environment department will be speaking to supermarket companies about what measures can be taken to ensure supplies to shops.
* The Bank of England has said it will take all steps necessary to protect the economy.
* DCMS held a meeting with a range of sporting bodies this morning – sporting events are not being cancelled at this point.
* The PM has said there is no need for panic buying.
* Whether local elections will be delayed is a matter for the Electoral Commission to advise on.
* The Foreign Office continues to work with the US authorities on what can be done to bring home the 142 Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship.  

* A SAGE meeting is expected tomorrow along with a further Cobra meeting on Wednesday.",24,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/ffut64/full_briefing_from_cobra_meeting_basically_just/

I know it is still technically flu season and not every cough is incipient covid19 but I can’t help thinking - especially after the Italy / Middle East developments - that this is how unknown-origin community transmission occurs. 

I got a surgical mask on before getting off at London Bridge and on the jubilee line tube the sheer mass of people (northern line down today as well) really made me think twice about public transport when/if we meet that magic 100 number.

Does anyone else have the same super-awareness of things like this too? Just curious if I’m overthinking.",23,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/f8fzwn/is_anyone_else_superattuned_to_coughing_etc_now/

fipuia,CoronavirusUK,Please critique my quick maths on the herd immunity plan,3/15/2020 5:25,"NOTE EDITS at bottom. I'll be updating this as I receive suggestions.

___________


Have posted as some comments, but thought it might benefit from being posted as a standalone.

I really hope I'm wrong... If anyone has comments/corrections, let me know and I can revise calcs.

- 66,000,000 people in the UK

- government says minimum 60% need to be infected for herd immunity

- Optimistically a 1% case fatality rate. Realistically, it could be closer to 5% once we start running out of ventilators. WHO was saying 3.4% last time I checked, but nowhere else has tried the strategy of doing almost nothing and hoping for the best, so maybe we will exceed that.

- Therefore 66,000,000 x 0.6 x 0.01 = 396,000 additional deaths is about the minimum the government are implying they're expecting.

To give some context, that is the equivalent of 144 x the twin tower attacks, or 7,071 times the 7/7 bombings, or if these deaths all occur in 2020, then 64% more deaths in the UK this year compared to normal.

This is before you factor in;

- CFR will go up when we run out of beds in the next few weeks

- routine medical treatment will have to be cancelled/postponed if hospitals are overrun, so people with otherwise preventable illnesses will deteriorate and die at a greater rate than normal.

- Attrition will take out front line medical staff due to PPE shortages

- Many more factors that will contribute.

If we were to run the numbers again with less optimistic, but still reasonable assumptions, we get much worse numbers.

- 66,000,000 people in UK

- Government delays implementing lockdowns too long and overshoots to say ~70% of people infected.

- Case fatality rate of 3.4% as per WHO estimate last time I checked.

- 66,000,000 x 0.7 x 0.034 = 1,570,000 additional deaths might happen if the governments assumptions are off, not even by that much.

________

EDIT: It may be the case that a greater percentage of people are asymptomatic than currently understood as there isn't reliable data, as there has been limited community screening undertaken. Early community screening has not revealed significant percentages of asymptomatic or unidentified cases. Current percentage estimates are currently based on there being no asymptomatic cases. Any percentage of asymptomatic/undetected cases will therefore reduce the CFR and reduce these estimates. I have no data to input for these, so can't reliably adjust the estimates. If anyone has sources which estimate asymptomatic cases, or a reduced CFR which factors in the asymptomatic cases, let me know and I can update. EDIT 3 follows on from EDIT 1... [South Korea has done screening](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fipuia/please_critique_my_quick_maths_on_the_herd/fkirkz1/?context=3) and puts CFR at 0.8%. Substituting this into my optimistic model above would yield 316,800 additional fatalities.

EDIT 2: It has been pointed out that this looks at the population homogeneously but in reality, CFR is much higher with age. If we were to isolate all of those over say 55 and let everyone else become infected then this would yield a [very significant reduction in fatality rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fipuia/please_critique_my_quick_maths_on_the_herd/fkiqzhj/).",22,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fipuia/please_critique_my_quick_maths_on_the_herd/

So what do you do about it if you get it?  Here's a bunch of stuff you can take that might help. Obviously they are no substitute for medical care if you can get it, and none of these are miracle cures, but none of them are likely to hurt you.


--------------------------------------


###Vitamin C###

Vitamin supplementation will be more effective in those that are deficient. However-

> ""supplementation with vitamin C appears to be able to both prevent and treat respiratory and systemic infections""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/

> ""The vitamin C protocol was evaluated in patients with severe pneumonia. Hospital mortality tended to drop in the treatment group.""

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944118307780



There's currently a clinical trial underway in China for it as a COVID19 treatment

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533

They will get [24,000mg](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=228745) intravenously per day. You can't take that much orally without [side effects](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/side-effects-of-too-much-vitamin-c), but 2,000mg per day is probably fine.



--------------------------------------



###Vitamin D###

> ""new global collaborative study has confirmed that vitamin D supplementation can help protect against acute respiratory infections.""

News: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/02/study-confirms-vitamin-d-protects-against-cold-and-flu/

Study: https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583

Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5yVGmfivAk



--------------------------------------



###Salt###

A saline nasal rinse multiple times a day may help: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37703-3



A nurse [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f52cj0/nursing_101_caring_for_your_loved_ones_at_home/) wrote that it is a good idea to do a    
> ""saltwater steam inhalation every 4 hours to coat the lungs with antimicrobial properties""



I can't find science to corroborate the claims, but nebulisers with saline do appear to be used to treat respiratory infections:

https://www.ecronicon.com/ecpe/pdf/ECPE-07-00196.pdf

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4644020/



--------------------------------------



###Mullein Tea###

> ""May treat respiratory conditions... May help fight viral infections""

https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mullein-tea

It's an expectorant (clears mucus from lungs), reduces inflammation, and has antiviral properties.

It's also used as an antimalarial: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/438064




--------------------------------------


###Zinc###

Zinc inhibits SARS/Coronavirus replication in vitro

https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176



From the Lancet's Reducing mortality from 2019-nCoV:
> ""Zinc and other metal-containing formulations appear to have anti-viral activity, are safe, cheap, and readily available.""

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30305-6/fulltext



> ""Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496046



However it is not recommended to take zinc for more than a few days in a row, or to use it long-term. (https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/qa/is-longterm-use-of-zinc-safe)



--------------------------------------



###Tonic Water###

Tonic water contains Quinine in small amounts. While there are no studies showing efficacy of quinine on COVID19 treatment, its chemically similar sibling Chloroquine does: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220301145

83mg quinine / litre of Tonic Water, so several litres of it a day could possibly be helpful.

--------------------------------------


Additionally, this is controverial, but consider not rushing to reduce fever unless you have to:

> ""A moderate fever (less than 40 °C) is beneficial""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4145646

> ""Popping pills for flu fever might make things worse""

#Avoiding a Cytokine Storm#

An overreaction of the immune system called a Cytokine Storm is what is likely to be doing the killing, according to these two studies: 

1. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30305-6/fulltext

2. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x

([News](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/the-coronavirus-turns-deadly-when-it-leads-to-cytokine-storm-identifying-this-immune-response-is-key-to-patients-survival-report.html))

It may also be why [children aren't typically severe cases](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237259-why-dont-children-seem-to-get-very-ill-from-the-coronavirus/).



I can't say this with authority as I can't find the data, but what I've gathered is that the cytokine storm happens at the late stage of the disease. So if you get to that point, consider-



* Snaffling down as much garlic as you can handle:

> ""The present study produced some evidence for an immunomodulatory effect of garlic, as well as the modulation of cytokine production""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23039014



* And Turmeric:

> ""The suppression of cytokine release by curcumin correlates with clinical improvement in experimental models of disease conditions where a cytokine storm plays a significant role in mortality""

http://iv.iiarjournals.org/content/29/1/1.full

N.B. Turmeric is better activated in combination with black pepper: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/turmeric-and-black-pepper#curcumin-absorption



* Additionally, *avoid* elderberry supplements as these increase cytokine inflammation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11399518/

Next, some of you are thinking that you're young so you're not worried about it. Let me change that for a moment. Not about dying. You know your chances are pretty good to not die from this. But, **the numbers of fit, young, healthy people who require hospitalisation to survive are significant**.



12% of 15-49 year olds (67 severe : 490 not severe) require hospitalisation, compared to 28.8% of >65 year olds.

fhg0nd,CoronavirusUK,Durham University Moving Online,3/12/2020 21:04,"""Dear students, 

This email contains an important coronavirus update.  Please take the time to read it carefully.  

The  health and wellbeing of the Durham University community and the wider  communities within which we sit must be the primary concern of all of  us at this time. Following advice from Public Health England, we will  shortly be implementing new actions to keep our communities healthy by  reducing potential exposure to coronavirus. Durham University will  remain open next week but we will be organising  some of our core activities differently.

Before  turning to details, I would like to stress the importance to everyone  of the need to follow the guidance provided by the NHS to limit the  spread of Covid-19. Also, if you do feel unwell, please dial 111 and do  not go to your GP or pharmacist.  

**Moving teaching online**

Classroom-based teaching will continue as usual until the end of this week (Friday 13 March).  

But,  from Monday 16 March until the end of Term (Friday 20 March), classroom  teaching of all forms (including small group teaching,  practicals, field classes, one-to-one meetings etc.), will cease.  Please do not turn up to classrooms next week.

Instead, teaching **will** be delivered next week but it will be online as far as possible.   

If  you wish to leave Durham following your last class this week, you can  do so. Others of you will stay in Durham  but will not be able to access your classrooms next week. We will make  every effort to ensure that all of you can participate in classes  remotely until the Easter break. You will also be able to access online  materials over the Easter break for revision purposes.

The Library will remain open.

These  decisions have not been taken lightly and are similar to those taken at  other leading universities around the world. They are  designed to reduce the immediate risk of infection to yourself, our  staff and our wider community.  

We  know that this may be not be your preferred method of learning and that  being in classrooms is an important part of your university experience.  However, moving to online learning will help limit exposure to Covid-19  by reducing group activities. This will help all of as the coronavirus  spreads.

Your  Department will be in touch shortly with more information on what this  will mean for you and details on how you can access online resources  to support your learning.""

fgnvvi,CoronavirusUK,Walk-in Center Experience in London after calling 111,3/11/2020 8:04,"I called 111 yesterday and today my girlfriend was forwarded to the walk-in centre (we just came back home). She has problems with taking breaths for the last 10 days (she has asthma, but never had an attack or anything like this), she also suffers from fever. 

Despite all those issues listed above, they could not test us as we did not meet a single of two main requirements which are:

- Be abroad in the last 14 days (like they believe that there is no chance to get infected inside the UK)

- Have contact with a person infected with coronavirus (how the fuck do I know that)


Even the doctor complained that they can't get tested and they can't visit family because they are scared of infecting them. 

Our general experience is okay, she was diagnosed with right lung infection so we got amoxicillin and 2 inhalers (asthma-related). Seems logical to get antibiotics, but don't you think it is a legit reason to test my girlfriend? She is a waitress in the city centre (Kensington). 

She does not suffer from cough or runny nose, just struggle to take breaths and fever... looks suspicious as fuck, we are just 24 years old.

[Tinfoil on]

Believe me or not, but the doctor said that it is government issue that they can't test us and them, and probably they just want to take the chance of the coronavirus so most of the elder people who are getting retire pension will eventually die. Like, I thought it is just me having such low-possibility chance conspiracy theories

fgb41d,CoronavirusUK,Today's prediction thread,3/10/2020 17:25,"What are your predictions for today's figures for UK Confirmed Cases?

Yesterday the figure was 319, an increase of 46 from the day before. The mean prediction on r/coronavirusuk yesterday was 358, with a median of 360, so as a community we overshot significantly.

The UK's trend has been around 29% increase each day for the last five days, which would be 411 today. If growth is still linear, then for the past few days growth has been averaging 54 new cases per day which would be 373.

Other countries, when they were in a similar position ranged from 368 (Japan) to 536 (South Korea) so its quite a spread. For comparable European countries Spain went to 397, Germany 492, Italy 444 and France 480.

More internationally China 471, USA 455, Iran 480.

Yesterday's growth was comparatively more favourable than Spain's performance. Was this a trend or just a blip and there will be a correction today?

I predict the figure for today will be 400 on the nose.

All of this is based on unconfirmed and unverifable evidence I don't expect or want to force anyone to believe this but experiencing this so local to you, with people you directly know is scary.

Similar to what has occurred to a school in Cheshire, around 30-40 students ranging from 13-15 years old with some adults went to a ski resort via bus in the northern area of Italy during half term, no one was at first suspected but now a teacher and a student have suffered from flu symptoms with a teacher told to stay at home while the student was told by a senior member to get tested for the virus.

Unfortunately for me I seen and been within close proximity of the student and so would of many others. I potentially fear that lots of people have got infected without even knowing.

Of course this assumes that the suspected people had the virus, but it seems like almost perfect timing for them to catch it with the outbreak in Italy known and a similar case in Cheshire being reported.

It also raises the point that more people could of originally been infected especially when people shared small rooms and spent 24+ hours in closed small coaches.

fk0zgd,CoronavirusUK,Anyone else frustrated with relatives?,3/17/2020 15:16,"Just over two weeks ago, I realised how serious this crisis was going to get. I know plenty of people on this subreddit realised earlier, but I didn't take much notice until then. I got a couple of months worth of food, medicine, and so on. I told my family to do the same.

My dad is sixty. He's very fit and hasn't ever had any health problems. I talked to him about exponential growth, about how the government guidance was not only wrong but dangerous, I think he just agreed with me to humour me. I shared many of the accounts from people in Italy and China, in case they were more convincing than the projected statistics. His response was that people lie on the Internet.

He watched Boris on the news yesterday and promptly went out and panic bought food, including foods he doesn't usually eat, and perishables that are no good for stockpiling. When I asked him about it, he said 'you have to join in, don't you?'

I'm frustrated that absolutely nothing I said convinced him to take it seriously, but as soon as the government did, he followed along. I'm obviously going to share my own supplies if he needs them, and will try to pick up some more for him. I'm annoyed with myself that I didn't think to do this earlier. Everyone knows that eventually they'll be the ones looking after their parents  instead of vice versa, but sixty isn't that old, and I don't think of him as being vulnerable because he's so healthy and still working. 

I'm frustrated with him for not listening to me and having a bizarre groupthink attitude that I haven't really seen in him before. I'm frustrated with myself for not realising sooner that he didn't take anything I said seriously, and taking action on his behalf despite that. And I'm ranting here on Reddit because, as someone posted a few days ago, saying 'I told you so' in person doesn't help anything.

As we all know, the NHS is already stretched to breaking point prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, and as we all know they're already under intense pressure with the virus. Theres been talks of bringing retired doctors and nurses back to work and help out, as well as medical students.

I have a proposition, and I wonder if you guys (the general public) would be able to say if you would be comfortable or not with this.

Within the veterinary community theres been a lot of talks of us wanitng to help. I am a qualified veterinary nurse in the UK. Theres a lot of talk witin the community of wanting to help the NHS and help with short staffing should we need to. A lot for vet nurses and vets seem very keen to help.

We know a LOT about medicine (probably know the most about medicine after doctors and human nurses, we know a LOT about infectious control and disease prevention and control (as we work with infectious diseases that we can catch daily). Although legally would not feel comfortable or be allowed to do actual procedures (which is rightly so), we can do TPR (temp, pulse, respiration counts), blood pressure checks, first aid, and generalised TLC to human patients. I am not sure if it would ever get to this point, however, i consider this a possibility. I would be happy to step up to the mark if i had to, as we know more than the majority of the population when it comes to medicine.

Does anyone, therefore, have any insight into why the government isn't prioritising the protection of NHS staff?  Surely this should be a core focus of the strategy!

My partner is a community nurse and so far they haven't received anything to either protect themselves or to ensure that they don't spread the infection to at-risk patients.  Their job mainly involves visiting elderly and severely ill patients in their homes.  Yet the only advice they have received from their seniors so far is to ""wash their hands"" and continue visiting patients as normal.

We have both accepted that we are at high risk of being exposed to this virus, but we are both very concerned that nothing is being done to ensure that the people who have dedicated their lives to helping others are going to be the people who are spreading this virus to those who need to be protected the most.",19,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fjnqps/why_arent_the_government_trying_to_protect/
fjidhl,CoronavirusUK,For those first time working from home,3/16/2020 17:41,"Having worked from home for many years here are some top tips:


* Get dressed, just because you're at home, doesn't mean you can rock up to work in your boxers / dressing gown. This isn't the weekend. Remember, self pride it's only a small step but an important one. Otherwise, before you know it you're at the local supermarket in your PJs and fluffy slippers and think it's acceptable!

* Lunch time drinkies. It's totally acceptable to go out for a work lunch, share a bottle of wine / have a couple of pints when you are in the office. Apparently, now that you are in the comfort of your own home, for some reason its no longer professional. Yeah, its a contradiction I know, so I'd lay off the lunchtime booze. But for the brave amongst you, maybe you could arrange a Zoom lunchtime meeting and it will become an acceptable norm. Who knows? These are unprecedented times!

* Don't waste the commute. Now you're not stuck in traffic or on the train, what are you going to do with that time? Two routes here:
   * Woke: learn classical guitar, a new language, do that DIY job you've been putting off for years.
   * Practical: have lie in - you deserve it.   
  
  For those opting for the self improvement route, good on you! I commend it but please don't guilt trip the practical folk by virtual signalling to the world - quiet pride is so much more dignified!

Last but not least, don't go blind. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co\_DNpTMKXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co_DNpTMKXk)",19,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fjidhl/for_those_first_time_working_from_home/

Hospital Authority releases its findings after observing the first group of discharged coronavirus patients

Some patients might have a drop of about 20 to 30 per cent in lung function, says medical director of Infectious Disease Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital

Some patients who recovered from Covid-19 have suffered reduced lung function and now experience problems such as gasping for air when walking quickly, Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority has revealed. The authority released its findings on Thursday after observing the first group of discharged coronavirus patients.

The city has so far recorded 131 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including three fatalities. Of them, 74 patients have been discharged while one probable coronavirus case has also recovered. Dr Owen Tsang Tak-yin, medical director of the authority’s Infectious Disease Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung, said doctors had already seen around a dozen discharged patients in follow-up appointments. Two to three were unable to do things as they had in the past.

“They gasp if they walk a bit more quickly,” Tsang told a media briefing on Thursday. “Some patients might have around a drop of 20 to 30 per cent in lung function [after recovery].”

Tsang, who also heads an authority task force on the clinical management of infection, said these patients would undergo tests to determine how much lung function they still had. Physiotherapy would also be arranged to strengthen their lungs.

A review of lung scans of nine infected patients at Princess Margaret found patterns similar to frosted glass in all of them, suggesting there was organ damage.

But Tsang said the long-term effect on recovered patients, such as whether they would develop pulmonary fibrosis, a condition where lung tissue hardened and the organ could not function properly, had yet to be ascertained.

He said discharged patients could do cardiovascular exercise such as swimming to help the lungs recover gradually.

The city’s public hospitals are about to conduct clinical trials on remdesivir, a drug originally developed to treat Ebola, to see how effective it is on Covid-19.

Tsang said the drug had already been delivered to hospitals. Doctors would begin identifying suitable patients to join the trials, which were expected to begin in the middle of this month.

He stressed that the drug could lead to some complications, such as affecting liver function and leading to inflammation of the blood vessels.

fhktgu,CoronavirusUK,School prosecuting for not visiting the GP and providing them with a medical note during self isolation.,3/13/2020 2:17,"Last Friday, after my daughter returned home from school, (after battling with the school for almost the entire week, after finding out they were not enforcing hand washing atall)
She became ill, high temp, onset of a cough, and other symptoms that coincided with COVID19, but also, coincide with other viral infections that she has had before. 

I followed the government guidelines, and kept her isolated for 7 days (this week) and obviously didn't take her to the GP, as that would be putting others at risk and going against the government guidelines. 

My daughter is alot better now, and while she was very under the weather at first, she did start feeling better within a few days, and it became more apparent, that it wasn't COVID19, (no breathing issues, the severity subsided) it seems it was another viral infection she caught from school, which she catches very often, now realising it's probably due to the complete lack of hygiene the school practices. 

But obviously, thought it best to continue following the government guidelines, and keep her isolated for the full 7 days, as we know, severity can subside, but then all of a sudden come back with a vengeance. 

I have today, received a letter from the school, notifying me of impending legal proceedings, whether that turns out to be a fine or imprisonment I don't know yet. 

I emailed the attendance welfare office about this, as she was the one that sent this letter. She has also completely ignored all the concerns I brought to her attention in a previous email, outlining the lack of hand washing at the school, directly after a confirmed case was found to be very close to my daughter's school, and also bringing to her attention the fact a teacher had removed my child's hand sanitizer, and hadn't notified me, which meant my daughter wasn't able to use it for the entire day, as well as the teacher not enforcing hand washing with the children. Also, an email from the headteacher regarding handwashing which stated ""I find it very difficult to monitor the teachers to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be doing ""

In the email I asked why she had sent this letter,  I was told it was because I hadn't taken my daughter to the GP this week and provided the school with a medical note for her absence for this week. 

I emailed back, and provided a link for her to the NHS website which states you must self isolate for 7 days if you have a fever, or a cough, and asked did she want me to ignore the government guidelines and take my daughter to the GP, and potentially put other people at risk / increase spread, had it turned out to be COVID19, just to provide her with medical evidence. 

I had kept the school updated on the entire absence and symptoms from the very day she began showing them (Friday) up until today btw. 

Also to add, I had emailed the headteacher and he had specifically approved this week's absence, and I have that as proof via email, which I forwarded to her. He had also agreed to send work to me, from my daughter's teacher. 

Where do I stand with this?

Funnily enough she's not emailed back since I directed her to the NHS website.

Yesterday the figure was 373, an increase of 54 from the day before or 17% growth.

Average growth over the last few days has been 23% which would suggest a figure of 459 today. Or if we're still in a linear phase average growth has been 52 new cases per day, so 425 total, although why its still in a linear growth phase is a mystery.

The average prediction on [r/coronavirusuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusuk/) yesterday was 412, with a median of 398, so as a community we've been overshooting significantly every day. Will you compensate now we know that?

Other countries, when they were in a similar position had next day figures ranging from a low of 440 (Japan) to 572 (Iran) so its quite a spread. For comparable European countries Spain went to 474, Germany 556, Italy 542 and France 549.

More internationally China 515 and USA 522.

Yesterday's growth was comparatively more favourable than any other European country's performance. Clearly the UK's winning trend can't go on forever, but will the correction start today?

I predict the figure for today will be 430.

Unlike Public Health England's 15 minutes of face-to-face interaction limit the experience from China is already very clear that 15 seconds without masks is enough for infection.

Experts state neither warm weather will much impact, Korea's chief scientist expects the outbreak beyond the end of the year. Dreams of vaccines at least two years away and likely ineffective and drugs again likely ineffective and at least six months away.The only things that can be done to prevent having health systems overrun and supplies exhausted are non-pharmacological interventions (ie restrictions of travel, quarantine and separation of areas into clean 'green' and part-infected 'red' blocks). At the moment just when they are needed when cases are coming into Britain from Asia, Iran, Italy and Spain, there are no steps sre being being taken. No gatherings postponed, no sense of trying to shift the economy online. London will take in a lot of visitors from all over Europe where infections are also exponentially rising (as all new respiratory viruses do without public action). It will be hitUnlike countries like Vietnam, Russia, Israel, Iceland, China and Singapore which have much tougher travel restrictions, the government has done little.

The government with total scientific ignorance or sacrificing scientific methods for the sake of 'the economy'. Ordinary Londonders will suffer the most and the economy will go along with it.

Those who may have come in contact are only selected by Public Health England's guesswork not by jogging the public's memory of infected people's movements in their incubation period, unlike Singapore. It has been leaked to the press that once the number of cases hits 100 then chasing contacts will probably dropped altogether, because the load is too much. COVID19 is precisely the Disease X the WHO warned of, a *highly* infectious virus which binds very quickly, with a very longer asymptomatic, infective period, with high lethality, the only peer-checked paper has data of over 15% needing ICU treatment, and 2.3% cases ending in death. We HSG and general public must modify our behaviour to not come face to face with others certainly not without PPE at a minimum face masks. Given that health staff need PPE the only logical step is to stop face-to-face socialising and concentrate trying to somehow pressue authorities to prepare quarantine hospitals, unfortunately all the capacity leaving little. All it takes is one person to infect a room. A cluster in Hong Kong had a family member returning from another part of China (not Hubei) for a meal at home. Every single participant 9 in total was infected.London is denser than both Wuhan and Daegu.Daegu is concerning because like Britain Korea claimed things were under control now doctors and nurses there are placing appeals for volunteers and equipment. Wuhan is still closed after about 40 days, shops can't be visited, bulk orders from buildings are placed and food prices have quadrupled.

All the models of incoming flights and social interactions point to a very serious outbreak in London.  Hospitals in London are lacking face masks. NHS 111's advice is very inconsistent. Patients will turn up in GP surgeries, A&Es or Walk in Centres, causing hospital infection, as has happened already in the UK, Germany, France and Italy.

We have got to be ready in London somehow for things turning into France, then Italy, then Korea then Iran within weeks or months.

More generally in order to save the economy, 'keep schools open' has been PHE & Matt Hancock's motto as opposed to Jeremy Hunt who has at least stated schools should be closed more.Please make the case for school closures and demand compensation from the government. Please do everything possible to delay the spread.

Please take the initiative in shutting down mass public gatherings - they are not needed. People can use their imagination and connect online in their own spaces not together.The economy in the future will be destroyed by the short-termism now.

In the outbreak of a new virus in 1918-1919 in the USA all epidemiologists agree the cities that closed their schools and banned public gatherings early where the ones that had fewest cases and infections.

fkof9x,CoronavirusUK,PM Boris Johnson answers questions in the Commons now,3/18/2020 20:02,"Watch live on [parliamentTV](https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/b4bb9e13-abb9-43ef-ab22-ef917055fb1a) or on sky news livestream on [YouTube ](https://youtu.be/9Auq9mYxFEE).

Announcements so far:

**TL;DR** Johnson *endorses all concerns and thoughts so far and thinks they are all valid and need thinking about,* but  ~~couldn’t give two sh*ts~~ has not announced anything of substance.

- **12:08** In response to Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson announces that legislation will be introduced to protect private renters from eviction. Corbyn demands to hear the details today.
**At 12:33** Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh asks for evictions to stop today. Johnson did **not** commit to asking the courts today to stop section 21 or any other evictions, and has given neither a timescale nor any details for this legislation.

- **12:10** Test increase from 5k to 10k per day, soon to be moving up to 25k. (unclear when)

- **12:11** Johnson says they have stockpiles of personal protective equipment and are following the best scientific advice in response to questions by labour MP Corbyn why not all NHS staff have adequate PPE.

-  **12:16** SNP MP Ian Blackford wants to see temporary universal basic income. Johnson does **not** commit to a UBI scheme or any other schemes to protect/supplement people’s incomes but thinks it’s important to *think about it* and thinks the previously announced business schemes are already very helpful.

- **12:24** Labour MP Chris Bryant urges PM to give clearer answers and provide better support for the people. Johnson responds by saying they will do anything it takes to support both businesses and individuals, yet gives no details.

- **12:26** Labour MP Florence Eshalomi doubles down on Chris Bryant’s concerns, especially regarding the problems faced by the self employed. Again, no actual answer from Johnson.

- **12:37** Conservative MP Theresa May wants to know what a sensible exit (from current and future restrictions) strategy looks like. Johnson will not give a timescale or details but is *certain that it will succeed*.


**12:40** The PMQ is now over but you can still rewind and watch on [parliamentTV](https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/b4bb9e13-abb9-43ef-ab22-ef917055fb1a). PMQ starts at time marker 12:00.

fj0iu3,CoronavirusUK,Why the UK's strategy amounts to a crime against humanity,3/15/2020 20:19,"**(1) The UK's strategy is not based on science:**

Science doesn't work via arguments from authority. You don't get to say “I am a professor, my opinion is X, therefore X is science”. Science is a collective activity, which progresses via empirical research documented in peer-reviewed scientific papers. No such scientific papers are being discussed. No relevant research is available into the disease itself, because it is a new disease. And no research is available into the behaviour of the British people at a time of national crisis like this, because it is unprecedented in the modern world. What this so-called “science” boils down to is a single claim: the population of the UK will not be able to abide by restrictions on their movement and activity, because they will get tired of it. This isn't science. It's a subjective judgement being driven by non-scientific motives. “Professor” Chris Whitty has prostituted himself to the government. He knows perfectly well that what he is saying is based on science which is shaky at best, and complete bullshit at worst. Doubtless he has been promised a knighthood by Johnson.

**(2) There is a very compelling economic motive for the UK's strategy, provided you have no conscience or morals:**

The UK, like many other developed nations, has a serious demographic problem that is only getting worse: we have too many old people. This is resulting in a pensions crisis which has forced successive governments to raise the state pension age. We also have a social care crisis – too many old and vulnerable people needing care, and not enough people willing to do the work for the money it pays. We also have a long-term problem with pressure on the NHS, much of which is caused by an aging population with age-related diseases. Finally we have a housing crisis, and many houses are currently occupied by old people who paid off their mortgages long ago. Allowing the disease to run free might get rid of over a million of these old people, and has the added benefit of letting the rest of the country get back to work much quicker than our competitors.

**Conclusion:** the UK's strategy is a cynical ploy to gain economic advantage, with no concern whatsoever for millions of people who are old, sick or otherwise vulnerable. It is not just a crime against the British people. The whole world is now fighting this virus. The whole of Europe is taking measures to contain it. The strategy being followed by the UK doesn't just lead to the deaths of millions of British people – it also undermines the global/continental effort to contain this terrible new disease. **As such, it amounts to a crime against humanity.**

This is why people like Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt were fearful of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings running this country. This is exactly the sort of heartless, dishonest, cynical “out of the box” policy that Cummings would come up with, and Johnson would front. Do not fall for his crocodile tears about people's loved ones dying. It is an act.

—-Date: March 11, 2020 at 18:29:53 EDTSubject: Latest on COVID-19 from UCSF's infection disease researchers

With -- help I was able to arrange a discussion yesterday on COVID-19 with USCF’s top researchers in infectious disease. Here are the notes. I bolded some of the more notable comments from the researchers.

UC San Francisco is either the #1 or #2 hospital in California depending on which survey you read. It is the 4th largest medical research center in the US, based on research grants.

————

University of California, San Francisco BioHub Panel on COVID-19March 10, 2020

Panelists -

Joe DeRisi: UCSF’s top infectious disease researcher. Co-president of ChanZuckerberg BioHub (a JV involving UCSF / Berkeley / Stanford). Co-inventor of the chip used in SARS epidemic.

Emily Crawford: COVID task force director. Focused on diagnosticsCristina Tato: Rapid Response Director. Immunologist.

Patrick Ayescue: Leading outbreak response and surveillance. Epidemiologist.

Chaz Langelier: UCSF Infectious Disease doc

What’s below are essentially direct quotes from the panelists. I bracketed the few things that are not quotes.

Top takeaways -

At this point, we are past containment. Containment is basically futile. Our containment efforts won’t reduce the number who get infected in the US. Now we’re just trying to slow the spread, to help healthcare providers deal with the demand peak. In other words, the goal of containment is to ""flatten the curve"", to lower the peak of the surge of demand that will hit healthcare providers. And to buy time, in hopes a drug can be developed.

**How many in the community already have the virus?** No one knows.We are moving from containment to care. We in the US are currently where at where Italy was a week ago. We see nothing to say we will be substantially different. 40-70% of the US population will be infected over the next 12-18 months. After that level you can start to get herd immunity. Unlike flu this is entirely novel to humans, so there is no latent immunity in the global population.\[We used their numbers to work out a guesstimate of deaths— indicating about 1.5 million Americans may die. The panelists did not disagree with our estimate. This compares to seasonal flu’s average of 50K Americans per year. Assume 50% of US population, that’s 160M people infected. With 1% mortality rate that's 1.6M Americans die over the next 12-18 months.\] The fatality rate is in the range of 10X flu.This assumes no drug is found effective and made available. The death rate varies hugely by age. Over age 80 the mortality rate could be 10-15%. \[See chart by age Signe found online, attached at bottom.\] Don’t know whether COVID-19 is seasonal but if is and subsides over the summer, it is likely to roar back in fall as the 1918 flu did. I can only tell you two things definitively. Definitively it’s going to get worse before it gets better. And we'll be dealing with this for the next year at least. Our lives are going to look different for the next year.

**What should we do now?** What are you doing for your family? Appears one can be infectious before being symptomatic. We don’t know how infectious before symptomatic, but know that highest level of virus prevalence coincides with symptoms. We currently think folks are infectious 2 days before through 14 days after onset of symptoms (T-2 to T+14 onset).

**How long does the virus last?** On surfaces, best guess is 4-20 hours depending on surface type (maybe a few days) but still no consensus on this. The virus is very susceptible to common anti-bacterial cleaning agents: bleach, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol-based. Avoid concerts, movies, crowded places. We have cancelled business travel.

Do the basic hygiene, eg hand washing and avoiding touching face. Stockpile your critical prescription medications. Many pharma supply chains run through China. Pharma companies usually hold 2-3 months of raw materials, so may run out given the disruption in China’s manufacturing.Pneumonia shot might be helpful. Not preventative of COVID-19, but reduces your chance of being weakened, which makes COVID-19 more dangerous. Get a flu shot next fall. Not preventative of COVID-19, but reduces your chance of being weakened, which makes COVID-19 more dangerous. We would say “Anyone over 60 stay at home unless it’s critical”. CDC toyed with idea of saying anyone over 60 not travel on commercial airlines. We at UCSF are moving our “at-risk” parents back from nursing homes, etc. to their own homes. Then are not letting them out of the house. The other members of the family are washing hands the moment they come in. Three routes of infection Hand to mouth / face Aerosol transmission fecal oral route.

**What if someone is sick?** If someone gets sick, have them stay home and socially isolate. There is very little you can do at a hospital that you couldn’t do at home. Most cases are mild. But if they are old or have lung or cardio-vascular problems, read on. If someone gets quite sick who is old (70+) or with lung or cardio-vascular problems, take them to the ER. There is no accepted treatment for COVID-19. The hospital will give supportive care (eg IV fluids, oxygen) to help you stay alive while your body fights the disease. ie to prevent sepsis.If someone gets sick who is high risk (eg is both old and has lung/cardio-vascular problems), you can try to get them enrolled for “compassionate use"" of Remdesivir, a drug that is in clinical trial at San Francisco General and UCSF, and in China. Need to find a doc there in order to ask to enroll. Remdesivir is an anti-viral from Gilead that showed effectiveness against MERS in primates and is being tried against COVID-19. If the trials succeed it might be available for next winter as production scales up far faster for drugs than for vaccines. \[More I found online.\]

**Why is the fatality rate much higher for older adults?** Your immune system declines past age 50 Fatality rate tracks closely with “co-morbidity”, ie the presence of other conditions that compromise the patient’s hearth, especially respiratory or cardio-vascular illness. These conditions are higher in older adults. Risk of pneumonia is higher in older adults.

**What about testing to know if someone has COVID-19?** Bottom line, there is not enough testing capacity to be broadly useful. Here’s why. Currently, there is no way to determine what a person has other than a PCR test. No other test can yet distinguish ""COVID-19 from flu or from the other dozen respiratory bugs that are circulating”.A Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test can detect COVID-19’s RNA. However they still don’t have confidence in the test’s specificity, ie they don’t know the rate of false negatives.The PCR test requires kits with reagents and requires clinical labs to process the kits.While the kits are becoming available, the lab capacity is not growing. The leading clinical lab firms, Quest and Labcore have capacity to process 1000 kits per day. For the nation.Expanding processing capacity takes “time, space, and equipment.” And certification. ie it won’t happen soon. UCSF and UC Berkeley have donated their research labs to process kits. But each has capacity to process only 20-40 kits per day. And are not clinically certified.Novel test methods are on the horizon, but not here now and won’t be at any scale to be useful for the present danger.

**How well is society preparing for the impact?** Local hospitals are adding capacity as we speak. UCSF’s Parnassus campus has erected “triage tents” in a parking lot. They have converted a ward to “negative pressure” which is needed to contain the virus. They are considering re-opening the shuttered Mt Zion facility. If COVID-19 affected children then we would be seeing mass departures of families from cities. But thankfully now we know that kids are not affected. School closures are one the biggest societal impacts. We need to be thoughtful before we close schools, especially elementary schools because of the knock-on effects. If elementary kids are not in school then some hospital staff can’t come to work, which decreases hospital capacity at a time of surging demand for hospital services. Public Health systems are prepared to deal with short-term outbreaks that last for weeks, like an outbreak of meningitis. They do not have the capacity to sustain for outbreaks that last for months. Other solutions will have to be found.

**What will we do to handle behavior changes that can last for months?** Many employees will need to make accommodations for elderly parents and those with underlying conditions and immune-suppressed. Kids home due to school closures\[Dr. DeRisi had to leave the meeting for a call with the governor’s office. When he returned we asked what the call covered.\] The epidemiological models the state is using to track and trigger action. The state is planning at what point they will take certain actions. ie what will trigger an order to cease any gatherings of over 1000 people.

**Where do you find reliable news?** The John Hopkins Center for Health Security site. Which posts daily updates. The site says you can sign up to receive a daily newsletter on COVID-19 by email. \[I tried and the page times out due to high demand. After three more tries I was successful in registering for the newsletter.\] The New York Times is good on scientific accuracy.

**Observations on China** \- Unlike during SARS, China’s scientists are publishing openly and accurately on COVID-19.While China’s early reports on incidence were clearly low, that seems to trace to their data management systems being overwhelmed, not to any bad intent.Wuhan has 4.3 beds per thousand while US has 2.8 beds per thousand. Wuhan built 2 additional hospitals in 2 weeks. Even so, most patients were sent to gymnasiums to sleep on cots.Early on no one had info on COVID-19. So China reacted in a way unique modern history, except in wartime.",18,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fhgjql/inside_info_about_covid19_from_infectious_disease/
fhdzl3,CoronavirusUK,Social media misinformation is f****** lethal,3/12/2020 18:03,"Got this from a well-meaning friend on Whatsapp.

[Here is an article debunking it](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/theres-a-facebook-coronavirus-post-going-viral-claiming-to-be-from-stanford-dont-believe-it/). I immediately sent it to my friend and asked her to forward it to everyone she sent the message to.

The message starts out with unsourced crap, and then moves onto downright dangerous misinformation. Who wrote this and why? It's as if it's been deliberately written to increase infection by giving people a false sense of security.

>From member of the Stanford hospital board. This is their feedback for now on Corona virus: The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air. Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous. Please send and share this with family and friends. Take care everyone and may the world recover from this Coronavirus soon. L

>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS 1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold 2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. 3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun. 4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it. 7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on. 9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 10. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water!

>THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.

>SHARE WITH FAMILY and FRIENDS

...what... the... feck.

>""This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun""

What's our body temperature again?

>""Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses""

fia0va,CoronavirusUK,People are part of the problem.,3/14/2020 8:36,"I'm a 17 year old who currently attends college. Despite all the fear mongering and warnings, people still feel the need to cough openly into the air and disregard any sort of precautionary measure or personal hygeine. This whole situation has made me realise how selfish people are, they are too proud to accept the fact that they could potentially be harming those around them with their carelessness. The behaviour of these individuals bothers me, people at college still feel the need to piss in the urinal and then walk out without washing their hands. People are so stubborn and unwilling to self isolate, this whole situation is bad, but these idiots are making it worse, even going as far as to cough into your face as a joke to say ""whoops I hope you don't catch corona"". My mom's stupid ass boyfriend has ""just a stuffy nose"" but is walking around the house like a slob all day long, touching surfaces and never washing his hands. I've even witnessed a careless, coughing old man snarl at me when I walked away from him, and give me the dirtiest look in existence as a result of me distancing myself from him. 

I'm concerned about my grades, and how schooling will operate when (or if) college closes down. The death rate for the virus is extremely low, however, I don't want to fall ill for close to a month (or potentially die), just because idiotic people can't be bothered to protect themselves or others around them. 

I've never been the type to worry about dying, or falling ill, but with the amount of careless people out there, and the increasing numbers of those who are infected  each day ; I cannot rule out the probability that someday in the near future I could be at a high risk. 

I disinfect my phone when returning home, and wash my hands with soap, I carry alcohol based hand sanitizer spray and I have masks coming in the mail (not sure if they protect me at all, but I'm sure they would prevent others from catching anything from me if I did have something, which I don't) 

I'm not taking any chances (neither should you).",16,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fia0va/people_are_part_of_the_problem/
fi6b7p,CoronavirusUK,Don’t know what to feel - feeling very tearful and anxious. Living with my dad (he’s 70) and worried about the future and don’t know what to believe.,3/14/2020 4:33,"I just feel so confused. Even writing this I don’t even know what I’m trying to say. Basically I’m scared and anxious about what’s going on and quiet tearful as well. I live with my sister, dad and we have a lodger. My Dad is 70 and has a few health problems including high blood pressure. I’m so worried about him because if anything happens to him not only would it be emotionally awful but we would lose our house and everything else (we worked really hard to keep our house after my mum died 3 years ago). 

Im making my dad stay at home as much as possible (we live in London) and I’ve lessened my contact with people (I’m currently unemployed which is beneficial at a time like this), but my sister works in retail so is in regular contact with people and so is our lodger. I’m doing all the things that I can do like wash my hands and clean regularly. My sister thinks I’m overreacting but I feel like I need to be wary because of my dad. Also, I feel like people are really downplaying what’s going. 

My sister’s reaction makes me think I’m overreacting but I also feel genuinely really worried about this. Im not seeing my group of friends cos they all work in London and it feels risky plus none of them are in a situation like mine. I’m aware the newspapers can really hype this stuff up but it feels like it’s not being taken seriously at all which is why I’ve tried to do what I think is best for me and my family. I just don’t know how to feel. The messages we are getting are so conflicting and confusing. 

Am I doing the right thing? Is anyone else feeling like this? What the hell should I actually feel?? Everything is so confusing!",15,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fi6b7p/dont_know_what_to_feel_feeling_very_tearful_and/

fd29vj,COVID19,Please consider downloading BOINC or folding@home to use your computers processor to help analyze COVID-19 research.,3/4/2020 5:56,"Hello all.

I believe this has been posted before on this sub, but I wanted to let many of the new members know about distributed computing and the potential it has to help research into COVID19.

Here are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/) are helping to combat COVID19.

Distributed computing is a fairly simple concept - a university, government research institution, etc takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces.  The data is sent out to anyone who is a member of that research team, your computer does the number crunching, and the finished product is sent back to the institution to be added to the whole body of research.  Programs like Rosetta (using the BOINC client) or folding@home can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time (I have three, soon to be four, computers running both clients full time, and a fourth I have running in the background).  The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.

To download Folding@Home and join the reddit team:

* Visit this [link.](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/) to download the FAH client

* Open the FAHControl

* Click “configure”

* Select the “Identity” tab

* Input **236269** under “team number”

To download Rosetta@Home and join the Reddit team: 

* Visit this [link.](https://boinc.berkeley.edu)

* Open the BOINC client

* Select “tools” in the menu bar

* Select “add task” and choose from the scrolling menu “rosetta”.

* Go to [this](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team.php) link, search for /r/covid19 (yes, I did name it after the COVID19 sub) and join the team.  Alternatively, it can also be found [here.]
(https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team_display.php?teamid=18781)

If anyone has any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

**Basics**:

* **Name of virus:** SARS-CoV-2

* **Name of illness:** COVID-19

* **R0 SARS-CoV-2**: 1.4 - 3.8 [2](https://bit.ly/2vpQDU6)

* **R0 Seasonal Influenza:** 1.28 [19](https://bit.ly/3afjSrk)

* ***Confirmed* Cases (World):** 92,137 (3/3/20 1300 EST) [13](https://ncov2019.live/data)

* ***Confirmed* Cases (Non-China):** 11,986 (3/3/20 1300 EST) [14](https://ncov2019.live/data)

* ***Confirmed* Cases (US):** 103 (3/3/20 1300 EST) [15](https://ncov2019.live/data)

* **Case Doubling Time (Non-China):** 4 days [18](https://coronainfo.xyz/)

* **Transmission Methods:** Respiratory droplet and touch/fomites [6](https://bit.ly/2VvvSAY), possible fecal-oral [21](https://wb.md/388zwDt), possible airborne (conditional) [28](https://bit.ly/2VynbWr)

* **Incubation Period:** 2-14 days [7](https://bit.ly/2T9cOXS)

* **Persistence on Inanimate Surfaces:** Highly dependent on surface and conditions. *Possibly* up to 9 days, but generally less than that [27](https://bit.ly/395aXIW),[29](https://bit.ly/3akp2CJ)

**Symptoms:** Fever, cough, SOB [8](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html). *It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.* After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath, with about **20% of patients requiring hospital treatment**. Notably, the COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat [9](https://bit.ly/2VCYOH8). Some atypical patients [may present](https://bit.ly/2TsQOWA) initially with GI symptoms.

**Clinical Features**: 
Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness. In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days. Between 23–32% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support. [30](https://bit.ly/2PzOzzD)

Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent *serious* manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. Most infections are not severe, although many patients have had critical illness. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity, 81 percent were mild (no or mild pneumonia). In a study involving patients with pneumonia, ""**lymphopenia** was common, and all patients had parenchymal lung abnormalities on computed tomography of the chest, including bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities. ... Among the six patients who died, D-dimer levels were higher and lymphopenia was more severe compared with survivors. [23](https://bit.ly/32ytr2b)

**Treatment**:

Healthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. ... The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. ... No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. **Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.** [31](https://bit.ly/2VwMvfu)

**Corticosteroids should be avoided** unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

[Professor Chris Whitty](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/christopher-whitty) said the social cost of the virus may include primaries, secondaries, colleges and universities up and down the country shutting their doors for more than two months. He was speaking as it was confirmed that the UK now has 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – the first case in Northern Ireland.

Professor Whitty told the Nuffield Trust summit: ‘One of the things that’s really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we’re going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months.’


Sports events and concerts may have to be cancelled and schools closed for more than two months if the UK is hit by a global pandemic of coronavirus, the chief medical officer has warned.


World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Thursday that coronavirus has the potential to become a global pandemic but this stage had not been reached.

Senior doctors from hospitals across England have said that the NHS “would crumble” if the number of those infected reaches pandemic levels.

The situation would mean doctors having to make “tough decisions” in order to free up beds.


Ministers are finalising the government’s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. [Matt Hancock](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/matthew-hancock), the health secretary, insisted: “There is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That’s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.”

fcwcn7,COVID19,To mask or not to mask: the seemingly endless debate,3/3/2020 23:40,"I live in Canada but used to live in Asia. And so I'm conflicted on this topic, because I see two very different points of view.

**Western Point of View:** It's Irresponsible to Wear a Mask When You Aren't Sick

I'm seeing an ever-increasing number of articles from Canada / USA / UK telling people NOT to wear masks unless they are sick. Notably, the [US Surgeon General](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160) tweeted as much a few days ago.

The main arguments against wearing one seem to be:

* It's causing a shortage of masks globally  
* People don't know how to use them properly, and may get infected by touching their face to readjust 
* The cheap surgical masks don't even work 

**Eastern Point of View:**  It's Irresponsible NOT to Wear a Mask When You Aren't Sick

On the other hand, I'm hearing from first hand reports in Korea that right now it's very socially taboo NOT to wear a mask. Certain malls or restaurants won't let people enter without a mask. 

The main arguments for wearing one seem to be:

* Any protection is better than nothing 
* Wearing one prevents you from touching your face
* You may be asymptomatic and sick without knowing it
* And perhaps [a sense of solidarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/opinion/coronavirus-face-mask-effective.html) (we are all in this together, instead of stigmatizing only the sick wearing masks) 

**Can This Debate Be Solved?**

As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it becomes more important than ever that the health authorities can agree on what is good health practice. And yet here we are, with radically different policies on masks implemented on different sides of the world. 

I'll ""show my cards"" on this issue: I have bought masks and intend to wear them if my city has a growing number of cases. After living in Asia I got used to wearing one when air quality was bad, so it's not a big deal for me. 

Still, I want to make an informed decision on the issue and not wear something that's useless. If the science is clear against wearing masks when healthy, I'll change my view. But all I've seen so far are opinions, not data.

So the question remains... to mask or not to mask?",400,320,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcwcn7/to_mask_or_not_to_mask_the_seemingly_endless/

f8lofv,COVID19,Why are so many young doctors dying of covid19 in Wuhan? It may be because they are exposed to a high viral load upon infection.,2/24/2020 12:17,"Recently there have been several tragic deaths of young doctors in Wuhan from covid19, including the 29-year-old [Dr. Xia Sisi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f86hfd/xia_sisi_a_29yearold_doctor_at_a_hospital_in/), the 29-year-old [Dr. Peng Yin Hua](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6zxfj/29_year_old_wuhan_respirologist_and_icu_doctor_dr/), the 42-year-old [Dr. Huang Wenjun](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8a8vn/huang_wenjun_a_42yearold_doctor_at_a_hospital/), and of course the 34-year-old [Dr. Li Wenliang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang). This is at some odds with general population data showing that deaths of covid19 tend to be highly concentrated in the elderly. It could be a statistical anomaly, but it does seem like death rates may be higher in young doctors than would be expected in the population. 

As an explanation, many of the most upvoted comments on these posts suggest that their immune systems might be suppressed due to overwork, poor sleep, and stress. To me, this seems to be an extremely unlikely explanation for many reasons, including the fact that doctors don't seem to die at relatively higher rates of other infectious illnesses such as influenza. 

However, some people have mentioned higher viral load as a possibility, which seemed more likely. I did some research and I found this 2005 study on the role of viral load in SARS (which is, of course, very similar to covid19): [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/pdfs/04-0949.pdf](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/pdfs/04-0949.pdf)

The study looked at an outbreak of sars in a particular housing area in Hong Kong. They found that people who had closer contact with the index patient had a higher nasopharyngeal viral load on admission as measured by RT-PCR. Crucially, they also found that people in this area were also the most likely to die. Some quotes: 

""**The median nasopharyngeal viral load in E block patients (5.09 log10 copies/mL) was much higher than in non-E block patients (0 log10 copies/mL) on admission (p<0.001)**... The overall case death rate among the 79 patients was 24.1%. The highest rate was in block E, which accounted for 79% of all deaths, while the death rate in patients living in E7 (the same block as the index patient) was 70% (7 patients). This rate is significantly higher than in other units (p = 0.001 by χ2 test). The index patient was one of the few patients from E7 who survived the disease.""

""Severity of illness did not differ between block E patients and non-E block patients when they were first seen at the hospital, despite higher viral load in block E patients. However, the death rate was higher in block E. **We have previously demonstrated that patients with high initial and peak viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples were more likely to show a less favorable disease course and lower survival rate (8,18).** Patients living in E7 who had highest nasopharyngeal viral loads explains why their death rate was higher than for those living in other units. The dilution effect resulted in a decreased viral load as the disease spread to other units and in a lower death rate.""

This data corroborates the viral load theory. It's not perfect evidence, but the theory also makes basic physiologic sense. A higher viral load on initial infection means that the virus will be able to do more damage and suppress the host's immune system further (lymphopenia) before the host can mount an immune response against the virus. 

Hospital workers are likely to be exposed to especially high viral loads of covid19. People who are hospitalized with covid19 infections are likely to cough more and require close contact for procedures such as IV placement and intubation. It is hard to know for sure, but healthcare transmission risk may have been especially high in the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, when people were not as aware of the high mortality rates of this disease. 

If viral load upon initial infection correlates with disease severity, this may also help to explain why some local clusters seem to have more severe disease, such as the family who all died of the disease. For some reason, people in these clusters may have been exposed to an especially high viral load. Ideally, we could measure the viral load of infected people with RT-PCR to test this, although it's hard enough to get basic yes/no tests for covid19 at this point. 

The viral load theory is not rock solid. It may not explain a large percentage of the variance in disease severity - certainly age seems to be a larger factor. But to me, it is clearly the leading theory why a disproportionate number of young doctors without apparent pre-existing health problems have died of covid19 in Wuhan. 

Healthcare workers putting themselves at risk to care for the sick during this pandemic are heroes. It is an urgent priority to have sufficient PPE available to our healthcare staff. We also need to have adequate space available to allow for the adequate distancing of staff and possibly infected patients. The viral load theory suggests that PPE and distancing are not only important for preventing healthcare workers from getting the illness but also decreasing the likelihood that they will die of the illness if they are infected.",307,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/f8lofv/why_are_so_many_young_doctors_dying_of_covid19_in/
f750k5,COVID19,Chinese respiratory expert warns tests show people who have recovered may still be infectious,2/21/2020 11:23," 

Recovered patients may still be infectious

In   a grim assessment, a key Chinese respiratory disease expert described   the situation of the epidemic as a “see-saw battle”, despite the drop  in  daily recorded cases in recent days.

“We   should not be relaxed. The figure may go up again,” said Zhao  Jianping,  head of an expert team working to contain the outbreak in  Hubei.

Zhao told the magazine *Southern People Weekly*   there were cases in China in which recovered patients continued to  show  traces of the virus through nucleic acid tests. There were similar   results in Canada, where nose and throat swabs taken from a couple who   had recovered from Covid-19 revealed they still had traces of the  virus.

A tiny country in latin america where nothing ever happened and worldwide events never really affected me. Whenever something scary seemed like it would happen, I was always able to reassure myself ""well, it won't be too bad here"".

Well, 6 months ago I moved to the United States. I live in Washington (hah) now, right at the epicenter of the outbreak.

I'm not particularly worried about the illness itself; I'm young, healthy, and so is everyone I care about who lives here. But I read about all these events being cancelled, and I went to the store today and half the shelves were empty, and it kinda hit me that shit's getting real in a way I've never seen before.

I'm only 18, so I haven't really experienced any scary world events that I can remember. Even the whole Ebola thing I don't remember being anywhere near this level. I feel so out of my depth. I'm glad my parents aren't here so they don't get sick, but I also miss the feeling of nothing being able to hurt me.

I don't know what to think, what to believe, and I flip-flop between panicking and thinking that everything will be alright. It just feels like I can't even make plans for anything, because I don't know how things will change. What will things be like in two weeks? In a month? In the summer? What would it take for things to go back to normal?

But let me take a step back.  Around early Feb a co-worker got the flu and went to the hospital for pneumonia. She got two other co-workers sick, and I went onto their shift to work overtime. The other two co-workers were working while sick. Brilliant, but they were the only ones who could come in. Fast forward a month later I am now having these symptoms.

Its been about 4 days actually. Sore throat and runny nose have been very minor, they have disappeared. What I'm trying to say, is that I feel well, energetic, I can still taste food, I feel line. But I have these symptoms with the lungs primarily as I described above. Restricted breathing, feels like Im not getting all the air I breathe in, and I feel actual physical aches in the lungs area.  Originally it was just the left lung, but now it's both. I still feel like I can run a few miles.

I just called my local emergency room, they don't have test kits, and they aren't willing to test people unless they have serious symptoms. So I guess I just pretend like everything is fine until my symptoms get worse enough to get tested. And in the mean time I get people sick and endanger people's lives including those who are older and at greater risk.

I need to pay my bills, for me I can probably not work for a couple years honestly. But, I don't want to lose this job, and I am only given an x amount of hours to take off. This is soo stupid, I want to just isolate myself, but then I risk losing my job. But if I do go to work, I endanger the people there especially the older personnel.

This is such a total cluster f\*\*k, a true demonstration of how shitty our planning can be. Smh

Edit: The two co-workers who were sick were older than me, one is late 50's or early 60's and a heavy smoker. She recovered just fine, same with the other guy. But another co-worker got sick she seems to be at the end of a cold of some sort, coughing all over the office. She is in her early 50's. I have no idea if they had the coronavirus. Im not even sure if I have the virus. But I nvr had anything like this, where I feel inflammation in my lungs, and random aches of sharp pain.",13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/feugtd/i_think_i_have_the_virus_but_theres_no_testing/
fe52x0,COVID19_support,Impact on the family,3/6/2020 8:30,"I maybe over doing it but, I'd rather be ready for nothing, then not for something. Only thing is my worries are effecting my family. I woke up today ready to limit our contact with people.  

My wife and 14yr old son and 13 yr old daughter were not to fond of this decision. 

I tried to reason with them that not enough tests are being done(until today) to know if your area is infected. Which in my understanding the CDC say to expect more cases. 

At the end of it I changed my mind, I saw my kids starting to worry and decided to just let them go to school. I worry cause my daughter is in flagline and they are having a show followed by family night at the school🤦‍♂️tonight. 

Is it to much for my type of thinking. I mean the anxiety and panic attacks that I'm having as well are not helping, the other day I started coughing and damn near fainted from fear. I just want to be able to protect my family especially if we get it and I know it could have been prevented. 

My fear is rooted around my Dad who is HIV positive for 18yrs now, who has copd and is diabetic. He lives with us,(They are not as educated in the HIV virus as I am. They do have basic understanding of it and know living with him does not mean we will get it.) and I fear this might be one he might not come back from,(he is 58yrsold) being he had 2 other occasions in which they were very close calls. 

For those of you interested I live in northeastern Ohio. We dont even have a case yet. Just this morning we heard of a couple possible ones, which we've had several like that which all were negative in this state.


Update: First case in couple counties north of me. My wife and kids still think I'm crazy.

Don't know how to act when everyone around me is taking it lightly. None of them have took the time to research this and, they think some of what I say are lies, just so I can prove my point.

It's very possible. That's how this thing traveled so quickly.

You have to remember that the network of humans touching each other is simply the landscape for a virus. It's like it's spreading in a petri dish - we are all links in a chain that can only separate from each other with EXTREME effort. And to coordinate this among so many people is incredibly ambitious, and complicated. Because we exist in a network. This has very little to do with you, individually.

To clarify: you MUST do your part to break the chain of transmission, and I would guess that 99% of the people reading this are already quarantining to the highest degree they are able, given the very hard decisions people have to make regarding pay and social connections. We are all doing the best we can.

My point is just that if you are regretting a handshake from 3 weeks ago, you can forgive yourself. And if you do find out you were infected, that doesn't inherently mean you did anything wrong.

Welcome to Night Vale   
A weird podcast in the form of small-town radio. Strange things happen every day and all conspiracy theories are real. There’s a new disaster every week, but at the end everything is (mostly) still ok. It’s younger in-cheek dry humour, and starts out fairly seriously but gets much sillier and campier over time.   
I find it comforting that no matter how bad things are in my life,  things in Nightvale are always much, much worse.

A silly character-driven sci-fi medical comedy set on a space station. Think Scrubs meets Star Trek.

Girl in Space
A scientist is just living a peaceful life in solitude doing science in her cozy space station with her robot assistant and pet goat, when suddenly after years with no other contact, a spaceship approaches, and adventure ensues.

I'm afraid because my mom needs medicines for blood pressure ttht cant live without and we must go every day to find them on a daily route, we can't stock as dont find that many and they are expensive as well

But I want to isolate us, I'm 40, very overweight with diabetes and blood pressure, my mom had lung problems in the past and is 70, my grandma is 91, we live together.

Now this, how can I isolate us as much as we can?, I purchased antibacterial gel, washable gloves and made homemade masks more for mind relief as I know they are not useful. I plan to buy canned food and got some vitamins, echinaccea and hidroxycloroquin as I read it was used to treat the coronovirus. My plan is to avoid as much going out as we live in a very crowded place and if someone gets fever start taking as many pills as possible, hospitals are not an option here. 

What I'm afraid is to be on the 20% that need assisted breathing, if that happens if first world countries like italy are letting people die as they have not enough intensive care rooms, here it will be chaos as we dont even have water on hospitals, thats why I cannot sleep, what happens if we need assisted breathing, we just die? what will happen also in the rest on the world if most people need it that its available, on Italy they let the elder die the people like me with diabetes die according to ani nterview to a doctor I read few days ago, also a ama on reddit the doctor said that in such cases they will do tought decisions, that means letting the weakest die.

resume: Hospitals are not an option here, and me and two more relatives that live together are in high health risk, I need to find daily pills but want to isolate, don't know how to do that and thats' why I'm very stressed.

So I pretty much spent my night browsing r/coronavirus for news and updates, and as you can guess that didn't exactly ease my fears. 

A lack of sleep would weaken the immune system and that was all I could think about on the ride home. I kept thinking about how I could've caught the corona and it'd be a matter of time until I started showing symptoms. 

(It didn't help there was a  guy a meter away from me at the Starbucks I went to after work, he was sniffing and dry coughing thanks to my paranoid, sleep-deprived brain, I was so scared and the more I thought about it the more convinced I was that he had the corona, and I wished there was some way I could've gotten him removed, tested and quarantined if need be).

I'm staying at home. I've stopped checking out books from the library. I'm terrified I'm going to make someone sick. I'm a little scared that I'm going to get sick and die. I'm more scared about my parents, who are 60 and diabetic (Dad's a type 2, Mom's a type 1, I'm a type 2), and my grandmother, who is relatively healthy but overweight and 81.

Most of all, I'm just scared and upset because I've come to realize how quickly everything can change. I've never seen anything like this before, with people panicking and hoarding things, with all the businesses closing. I worry about who will take my dog if I get sick. I know my parents would take care of her if I died, but what if all three of us die? Who will take her then?

And...the air is different. I feel antsy and agitated. And I'm having religious issues, too (don't worry, I know this isn't a religious forum, I'm not going to talk about those, I'm just putting it into context). I've been extremely emotional and crying a lot, which is unusual for me.

fki9kf,COVID19_support,The science behind the UK's Coronavirus policy.,3/18/2020 10:40,"The delay phase of the UK's COVID 19 policy has been one of the most controversial of all the responses to the disease, particularly due to the previous 'mitigation' strategy that appeared to involve deliberately exposing the majority of the healthy population. However, the UK government is apparently shifting to a different strategy (thank god) which, like most of the world, is based around suppressing the initial peak of the epidemic quite forcefully rather than just rounding it off. The study is here:

 [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) 

I'm not an expert by any means, so I'll leave you to judge it. But this is actual science with real models rather than some kind of plot by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to wipe out all the poor and elderly to save the economy. Some points:

\- According to the models it will be possible to continuously suppress the pandemic at manageable levels all the way through the year by interspersing periods of social distancing with periods of relaxation. This, at the very least, shows that an end-game is being taken into consideration. In fact UK planning seems generally based on long-term expectations that the disease will resurge in the winter months.

\- The models don't seem to factor in the arrival of an effective treatment later this year (very possible), or the possibility of switching over to a contact-tracing based method. Mass surveillance is briefly mentioned as a possibility but not actually factored in either. These could make suppressing later re-occurrences easier.

\- The models do not include mandatory quarantine for the entire population (lockdown). Assumed compliance rates with the voluntary measures in place are given in the report. This should limit the economic damage inflicted by a full lockdown (remember that economic damage can have consequences in lives too), but I think compliance may end up needing to be enforced otherwise fatigue may limit the effectiveness of these measures. Anecdotally a lot of people here outside of London aren't taking things seriously yet, although this is only just the start.

\- The fatality rates given are useful outside the UK context and should be encouraging for those who are panicking over doomsday scenarios. For instance a totally-uncontrolled epidemic in the USA is 'only' expected to lead to the death of 2,200,000 people (510,000 for the UK). Remember that these are not back-of-an-envelope calculations that apply a flat casualty rate over the entire population of the kinds we see from fearmongers, these are the result of simulations carried out by highly-qualified professionals entrusted with guiding government policy.

There are plenty of intelligent and well-educated people out there who can make up their own minds and judge the plans for themselves, but it should be of some reassurance to those who have been stressed out by this unprecedented crisis that at least they exist and are available for scrutiny. I recommend everyone read this paper properly: it was written in language that politicians can understand after all, scientific jargon shouldn't be a big barrier here! :)",12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fki9kf/the_science_behind_the_uks_coronavirus_policy/

However, my mum is taking a more devil-may-care attitude and has said things like ""if I catch it, I catch it."" She is still going out socialising with friends, for example going out for meals and going to the cinema. 

Tomorrow night, I'm due to go out with my mum and some of her friends to a local restaurant for a meal. To make it worse, the organiser of the meal has just returned from a holiday in Egypt. I asked my mum whether she thought the meal out would be cancelled. I also said I don't think it's a good idea for us to go, as several other countries have already shut down bars and restaurants (I'm from the UK and I think our government is dithering too much with regards to asking people to socially isolate, so I've been following what governments in other European countries are doing. I also started working from home as of this morning). When I mentioned this, my mum got annoyed and said ""so I can't go to the cinema and now we can't even go out for a meal. It's boring staying at home and it feels like life is on hold!""

It's a shame because this meal out had originally been planned many weeks ago, but we had to postpone it because of people being ill (non-coronavirus related).

I don't mind social isolating, personally - I've got loads of books, magazines, films and online courses I can catch up on over the coming weeks, and everything else (eg restaurants) will still be there once all this is over. My mum has lots of books she hasn't read and CDs she hasn't listened to, so I don't know how she can say it's boring staying at home. I guess I'm more introverted.

My university announced that all classes will be online for the rest of the semester. This has been happening elsewhere, but I didn’t think it would happen here. I thought that, since I am young and healthy, I wouldn’t have to worry. And I still don’t think that I’ll get severely ill even if I contract COVID19. 

But I am terrified of the self-isolation. 

I have depression that gets exacerbated when I self-isolate on my own. I live alone, the vast majority of my social interactions are at school, and my family lives in another country. Once I heard the news that classes would only meet online for the rest of the term, it sunk in how much I enjoy school and how much of my social needs it fills. I have a hard time learning through online classes, so I’m nervous about coping with that too. 

I’m also feeling greater anxiety, like this is uncharted territory in our times. The world is afraid, people are stockpiling, major events are being cancelled. I know I’m young, and this hasn’t happened in my lifetime, but this is not normal. When will we feel safe again?

They’re both missing some fun events that had been planned at school and I assume they probably won’t make them up. 

I’m also very worried about what will come after, when school is back and the virus has run it’s course. Will things just go back to normal? Will some aspects of our life be different? Will a lot? I know so many kids grow up in horrible conditions and have very unfortunate childhoods. Some never make it out of childhood. Am I being really selfish for just wanting my kids to be able to continue down the path of “normal” childhood they were on a few weeks ago?",12,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fht8jw/anyone_else_just_plain_sad_for_their_children/

fgopnt,COVID19_support,"Seriously overwhelmed right now, supposed to travel to California tomorrow",3/11/2020 9:02,"This whole situation has got me extremely anxious, but right now there's something specific I'm really worried about.

I'm supposed to fly to California tomorrow, and a big part of me wants to cancel. I'm supposed to fly in to SD, meet my long distance girlfriend there and spend about a week driving up the state and staying in the cities, then fly out of SF. All the while, we will be attending concerts. None of them have canceled, all of them are likely to be 1 to 2 thousand people. 

My parents both work in infectious disease, my mom's a nurse and my dad's a doctor. Dad used to work at the CDC for a decade or so, a long time ago. They both think I'll be fine, if I get the virus, so that's comforting. But I've also been following the coronavirus subreddit and it is pure nightmare fuel. I'm 28 and relatively healthy. I *think* I should be fine, but there are so many stories of people who are young who are *not* fine.

I would gladly cancel this trip except for a couple of things. First, my girlfriend will absolutely kill me. She really doesn't think this whole pandemic is a big deal and thinks I'm crazy for even considering canceling, ruining her plans at the last minute. There's also the money. We each dropped about $500 on this trip, nothing is even a little bit refundable, and if I drop out she's going to ask me to pay for her share of it, since she doesn't want to cancel. 

I am generally an anxious person and a bit of a hypochondriac. Nobody around me seems to take the disease even a little bit seriously, meanwhile I am absolutely freaking out. Not just about the trip, but in life in general. I'm stocked up on food and supplies and every time I go to work I have a gut feeling I should just pack it in and stay home.

I don't live with my family or my girlfriend and I recently moved across the country. I have a fair number of friends here but I don't feel that there is anybody I can vent or talk to about this. It's driving me nuts. I don't want to get sick. I don't want pneumonia, I don't want to die, I don't want people around me to die. My dad is 78, has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure and just diagnosed with diabetes. And he insists on working (in a hospital, in infectious disease). It feels almost inevitable to me that he is going to die from this. I'm terrified of that, just as much as I'm terrified of my own health.",10,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgopnt/seriously_overwhelmed_right_now_supposed_to/

ffrpc5,COVID19_support,"I've had zero social life since the first case of coronavirus here in Vancouver in Jan 27, at ""voluntary"" social distancing at the demand of my parents. I don't know how much longer I can take.",3/9/2020 16:43,"This is going to be as much about my unhealthy relationship with my parents/living situation as the actual outbreak itself. I am going to try to not make this political so please don't make it political (think that's not what this subreddit is about anyways).

We are from China, but I've been a Canadian citizen for over 20 years and I actually haven't visited China for over 2 years. I am just over 30 but I am sure many of you would understand that I am still living at home since I am not married. I've actually lived on my own for 3 and a half years when I worked away, but have since moved back in when I transferred back to Vancouver, and never really enjoyed living under my parent's roof. Its very much ""their"" house even though I have joint ownership of it. 

My mom worked in public health in the past and still has friends in that sector. She has WeChat groups with people who are still actively working, so she claims she gets accurate information. Unfortunately from what I can see, the misinformation is just as rampant. She claims that she has never seen an outbreak that warranted a city lock down since shes been born, and that's why it needs to be taken seriously.

I had plans to go out on Jan 27. The evening of Jan 26 was when local misinformation started circulating, and a local city councillor posted rumours of a person who called her saying they were discharged from hospital here, went back to Shanghai, and got diagnosed with coronavirus. Parents panicked, they told me to cancel my plans, don't go to restaurant, public place, etc. I said I am still going to work, how can I even hide from this, and I never thought there's no cases here anyways, but the risk is low so why the heck are you demanding this of me. Nevertheless, the shouting match ended in me canceling my plans and agreeing to stay home. It angered me further when the rumours were false the next day, but Vancouver did announce its real first presumptive case. The beginning of social distancing that day also meant that I watched the Superbowl at home a few days later, instead of going out, having fun. A few days later they furthered the demand to avoid more public places like the gym. 

We had more fights over the next month, I said I'll stay home and appease them, but if there are no local cases for 2 weeks I am ending the madness. Unfortunately, every week here would be one case that trickles in and ruins my count. I'd have more fights about them listening to misinformation, panicking for no reason, not following local guidelines, not trusting local health officials. They'd say I am naïve, don't know how to protect myself, protect my family, etc.

The thing that doesn't make sense is that I go to work full time. I am a pharmacist myself and have peers who are by no means stupid. I see the panic buying that has ransacked our shelves of hand sanitizers, rubbing alcohol, and gloves. We haven't had masks since Jan 20 ish, for some reason that's not been in good supply since the flu season of 2018. I see that if there is an outbreak, there's almost NO way that I can avoid it being in the position that I am in, all I have is my own immune system and the hope that I am one of the 80% mild symptoms. Avoiding restaurants and social outings seems to be a negligible effort to me, and it has killed me emotionally. Meanwhile I am hearing about my friends going out, there are still events going on around to attend, like the 10 year Olympics anniversary, there was a WWE televised event, Wetsuwet protests (HA), none of which I can attend but I see tons of people going, and I am sitting at home after work doing pretty much nothing, and yet somehow that's supposed to protect me when I go to work with NO protective equipment and would be called an idiot for wanting to put on protective equipment. We've also had countless fights about stop trying to hunt for masks, I've read countless sources that they don't work, and finally I found a report on one of the coronavirus subs that say they do.

They claim that nobody is putting chains on me to force me to stay home. I wonder if anyone would even understand the moral chains and guild tripping Asian parents can put on you... 

Its embarrassing when friends joke about it being ""house arrest"". Its embarrassing when people at work ask me what I've been doing my days off and I say ""nothing"". Its embarrassing when I seem to be the nut swimming in misinformation and panic. But I also do know the seriousness of this outbreak, entire provinces and countries even wont be quarantined if it wasn't serious. I am still going to work, healthy, its better than being stuck in a tiny cabin afloat on one of the cruise ships, being refused entry and help from multiple governments around the world.

But it just makes my blood boil wondering wtf I've been doing the last 6 weeks. It makes my blood boil thinking about the last 5 or 6 weeks of my life that I'll never get back way BEFORE the situation here got serious. I have way more scattered thoughts that I don't even know to post in this one message that might still come to mind later. Are my friends who are still going out and having fun the idiots? Or are we the idiot for staying home and freaking out way before the outbreak gets here? I don't even know...

Meanwhile, perhaps its right to do my part to protect the parents (as much as I hate them), and prevent the drama that's sure to ensue if I did catch it, protect the idiots I work with, protect the patients I interact with, etc... I honestly don't care that much about myself personally...",14,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffrpc5/ive_had_zero_social_life_since_the_first_case_of/
ffpcxo,COVID19_support,How to use math to figure out how likely it is that someone at your workplace is infected,3/9/2020 12:39,"[Cross-posted to [China_Flu](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ffhhm2/how_to_use_math_to_figure_out_how_likely_it_is/).  I think it is appropriate here because it will help people panic less and be less anxious if they can make a decision such as whether to go to work based on an informed judgement rather than vague fear.]

Do you ever wonder how likely it is that someone at your workplace is infected?  I'm going to show you how to use math to approximate how likely this is.  I'll use two cases to demonstrate the method.  When applying it to your own workplace, don't just change the numbers, you have to understand the math so you can adapt it to your particular situation.

Case 1: Andy works in a city with a population of 1,000,000.  On April 1st, there are 20 symptomatic cases of the virus.  He works in a job where he interacts with 100 new people every day.  What are the odds that he'll interact with someone who has the virus on April 1st?  On April 5th?  On April nth?  When will the probability first surpass 5%?

Answer:

First we'll figure out how many actual cases there are.  Assuming Andy's city is not doing anything to contain the virus or slow the spread, [the number of infected people will double every four days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).  Let's take our [average incubation period to be 5 days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).  (Andy can play with these numbers to be more or less careful and see how it affects the answer).  This means that on average, the number of symptomatic cases will be equal to the number of infected people *5 days ago*.  So there were 300 infected people 5 days ago, which means there are 2^(5/4)20 infected people on April 1st, which is about 48.

So far so good.

Now, on April 1st, what are the chances that a given person Andy interacts with will have the virus?  We divide the number of infected people by the population: 49/1,000,000.  The chances that they don't have the virus is 1-48/1,000,000.  The chances that *none* of the 100 people Andy interacts with have the virus is (1-48/1,000,000)^100.  Thus the chances that any of them have the virus is 1-(1-48/1,000,000)^100 = 0.5%.

What about on April 5th?  Now 4 days have passed, so the number of infected people has doubled.  It is now about 96.  We run the same calculation again, to find that the probability that any of the 100 people Andy interacts with has the virus is 1-(1-96/1,000,000)^100 = 1.0%.

On April nth, (n-1) days have passed from April 1st so the probability is 1-(1-2^[(n-1)/4] 48/1,000,000)^100.

To find when it first surpasses 5%, look at desmos: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hpxghaqepg  You can see that this happens on the 14th day, or April 15th.

Case 2: Brenda works in a city with a population of 80,000.  On day 0, there are 10 symptomatic cases.  At her job, she works with the same 50 people every day.  If someone displays symptoms, they are put on mandatory sick leave.  What are the odds that at least one of her coworkers comes to work with the virus on day n, given that none of them have yet been put on sick leave?  How is the probability affected if one of them is put on sick leave?

Answer:

We'll make some simplifying assumptions.  Let's say Brenda works every single day, including weekends.  Also let's say that the incubation period is always exactly 5 days.  Again, you can alter these assumptions to see how much the solution depends on them.

As above, the number of actual cases in Brenda's city can be approximated as 2^(5/4)10=24.

On day n, there are about 2^(n/4)24 actual cases in Brenda's city.  Her coworkers are asymptomatic, which means that if they contracted the virus they contracted it with the last 5 days.  How many people contracted it in the last 5 days?  Well, 5 days ago, 2^((n-5)/4)24 people were infected.  So we can subtract to find how many people contracted the virus in the last n days: 2^(n/4)24 - 2^[(n-5)/4] 24 = 2^(n/4)24 - 2^(n/4)2^(-5/4)*24 = (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24.  The probability that a given coworker didn't contract it in the last 5 days is 1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000.  Thus the probability that none of her coworkers contracted it in the last 5 days is (1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000)^50.  So the probability that at least one of them has the virus on day n is 1 - (1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000)^50.

We calculate some values:

Day 0: 0.87%
Day 1: 1.0%
Day 2: 1.2%
Day 3: 1.5%
Day 4: 1.7%
Day 7: 2.9%
Day 14: 9.4%
Day 21: 28%

Now, if one of Brenda's coworkers is put on sick leave on day n, all her other coworkers could have been infected in the last 5 days at work.  Brenda can estimate how likely this was, based on how careful she thinks her coworkers were being.  Say she estimates that each coworker had a 1% chance of catching the virus from the infected coworker each day.  Then there are 5(days)50(workers)=250 opportunities for the virus to be caught, so the probability that it is caught is 1-(1-0.01)^250 = 92%.  So she can be reasonably confident that someone at work is infected.  Suppose people are way more careful and Brenda estimates the probability that a worker catches the virus on a given day as 0.1%.  Then the probability that someone has the virus on day n is 1-(1-0.001)^250 = 22.1%.

___________________________________________________
The above has been a [Back-of-the-envelope calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation).  The point is not to be completely accurate, but just to get the answer to within an order of magnitude, i.e. probably less than ten times too big or too small.  There were many assumptions made, and they can be modified to get different answers.  I hope this technique is helpful to people.

Some things I didn't account for:

If you're not in South Korea, you probably don't know the number of symptomatic cases.  Rather, you just know the number of confirmed cases.  You'll have to do some approximation for how many confirmed cases you think there are.

If the people you interact with in your job are largely from a certain community, then a symptomatic case in that community contributes way more to the probability of an infected person at your workplace than a symptomatic case elsewhere in the city.

And much more...",11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffpcxo/how_to_use_math_to_figure_out_how_likely_it_is/

So, there’s a news everywhere at anytime - YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and I can’t get over it. Of course, I read and watch some videos about it, but not from the news channels, I watch it from our Ukrainian famous doctor and USA docs. Today first case in Ukraine announced and it was the first I saw today when I woke up (on Instagram). And when i see a clickbait video or see any news report from TV - my body starts to shake automatically and I start panicking. I don’t even interest in things I was. It’s scary to live in this world right now, i really scared that it might get so bad that our planet couldn’t handle it (but I wish it will be alright from the bottom of my heart). I’m only 20 and I’m just sitting like I’m old and lazy and absolutely apathetic. I started to care about health more, and even saw the articles or videos which calm down but I’m so paranoid;( I need help to calm me down",11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fcv9md/i_cant_deal_with_my_anxiety_try_to_calm_myself/

Actually it's pretty fucking hard..... If you can do it it will give you something positive to look at.  
Your toughest times in life will give you some of the biggest learning opportunities. Every disappointment and difficulty gives you a chance to learn and grow in some way.  
If you can shift your perspective to look at just one difficult thing you’re facing right now as an opportunity to learn and grow, it can give you a positive silver lining to focus on.

What am I personally grateful for in terms of a learning opportunity? A few things:

* Learning how to stay calm in difficult and uncertain times
* Learning how to work remotely, and away from everyone else (we just got locked down in San Francisco....)
* Learning how to be a better son to my mum and dad, who are half-way across the world in isolation in Australia, by calling them more and not leaving anything unsaid to them

Hope this helps! I encourage y'all to think about what you can reframe as a learning opportunity. Can help you be a tiny bit more positive, which I think we all really need pretty badly atm...

I wonder if any of you know any other beautiful, inspiring and uplifting initiatives? Please share them

I'll go first:

* In the Netherlands hashtag ""#coronahulp"" is getting a lot of attention on social media. People offer to do groceries for elderly and others who are at high risks or to drive them (so they don't need to visit the crowded super markets or use public transport, and be able to keep social distance), or to babysit children whose schools are closed.

* I also came across a story of an anonymous donation of face masks to a police station somewhere in Asia, but I can't find the details

* update/ added: last Tuesday, 17 March, 20.00 all around the Netherlands people went outside at their balconies and in their gardens to cheer for the health care professionals who are working their asses of

* update / added: This Friday at 8.45 in the morning, across the whole EU radio stations will play the same song together: ""You'll never walk alone"". Mostly Dutch stations, since it is a Dutch initiative, but BBC, Studio Brussel a.o. will also join.

Today it would be very simple to just share a video, a tweet or a post in reddit or any other social network about your medical conditions and personal insights.

Options:

- Everybody who's infected is told not to share any information to prevent panic.

- Nobody wants to share such a painful experience.

- Nobody is actually recovering.

- Nobody was ever told to suffer from Covid-19.

I have a mild case of GERD but is always mild even when i forget medication, worst case scenario is im sick with acid once in a blue moon. One of my kids was born with a condition that affects physical and mental development. He's had a few seizures in his life which were often sparked by heat provoked by mild chest infections. On top of that, kidney function is not fully 100%.

My father has COPD and is currently in hospital for the next couple of weeks due to abcesses being found on his spine.

My mother who regularly visits him has a heart issue (something to do with an extra valve and body current, i don't know for sure), a condition called M.E and pretty much only has one working kidney. She's a large woman too that despite constantly dieting the past 10-15 years has barely lost any weight possibly due to retention issues.

I was already a highly depressed and anxious individual to begin with long before this. But this has well and truly consumed any joy and hope in my life. Even worse, i almost fell prey to my emotions and attempted suicide not too long ago. All my hobbies and interests have came to a halt, i can't sleep due to the sheer overwhelming fear and it gradually gets worse as more news pops up in the UK where i live. And as much as i try to tempoarily step away from the news, the feeling of it looming pushes further and further into my head.

People are prancing around saying 20% will need treatment and only those with underlying issues will have problems.

I haven't articulated these thoughts yet, so I'm grateful that this sub exists.

Anxiety is currently at about 11 because we're planning to travel next week for a family vacation in Florida. Also planning a day at Disney World during that time. This morning, just got a directive from work that we are to limit travel for in-person meetings and conferences indefinitely, and need to notify management of ANY upcoming air travel. That's fine, I assume I will probably have to work remotely for some time after we return, which is no big deal or disruption to my regular routine. But it makes the situation seem so much more grave, especially with the messaging coming over the weekend. 

I know what you're thinking! u/MaggieLulu, listen to yourself. You're going on vacation in less than a week! Enjoy the beach and family time and soak up that Vitamin D! I'm thinking that too! Believe me, I'm trying very hard to focus on vacation and the good parts of getting out of dodge for a while. We do this trip every year with the fam and it is usually a welcome respite from dreary, snowy midwestern weather and the grind of our jobs and routines, but I keep thinking about how this seems like the exact wrong time in this virus outbreak timeline to do that travel. It seems like the timeline is rapidly accelerating as more cases emerge in the US, so what will things look like when we leave for the airport next Saturday? What will they look like when we come back? 

Don't get me wrong, it will be good to be with my family for sure, but I am so anxious about what-ifs. What if we get stuck in Florida? (I know, that sounds great, but what about our pets, what about our jobs, etc.) What if we get sick? What if my elderly in-laws get sick and I can't help them? I know rationally there is nothing we can do about the spread of this virus beyond hand-washing, being vigilant about cleanliness and personal immunity, but I think about these things and everything just snowballs! I just want to enjoy my time in 75 degree sunshine, dammit!

In reality, I feel we've done all we can to prepare our home for quarantine/illness/supply shortages without going overboard, so we will be fine when we return from vacation. And most importantly, I know that I can't really do anything more besides live my life and enjoy what I can. After all, coronavirus fears aside, there is no way to know what the next weeks, months or years can bring in general. Expect the best, prepare for the worst, right? It's pushing down that nagging interior monologue and just enjoying the present that is causing the most problems for me right now.

**Killing COVID 19 on surfaces with Rubbing Alcohol.**

I have been wiping my counter top with it everyday!  **I  pour it on my counter, then I spread it evenly all over with a paper  towel until the whole counter looks wet with it and then just let it  dry.**... but that doesn't take 5+ minutes?!

fju7hh,COVID19_support,"Help with strategies to alleviate feeling ""trapped""",3/17/2020 6:53,"Hi guys!  I have been really struggling with adjusting to life with all of this going on (which is funny because when I give others advice I sound like I'm coping so well, but I'm definitely not!).  I have some mental health issues anyway and wasn't doing too great before this started, but then this kicked up and I spiraled down pretty fast.  I've had a rough last few months and the only thing that got me through was thinking of a big trip I had planned at the end of this month.  Well of course we cancelled, which selfishly I'm distraught about, but more than that is that the sheer panic everybody else and the media is displaying is too much for my already anxiety overloaded mind.  I've completely shut down these last few weeks and the only thing that was keeping me going was going to the gym and movies and my favorite places to eat with friends to get my mind off things. I'm not scared of getting the virus myself like many others are. I'm more worried about my mental health state and how I'm going to get through this.

There was a situation in my life about 6 years ago, would rather not discuss it in detail, but ever since I have had recurring problems where I either feel ""trapped"" and panic or fear being ""trapped"" and panic.  This can be in a variety of scenarios, whether I'm on a plane and they shut the door and push back or if I've just signed a lease for a new apt and started a new job and then feel trapped in the city I'm in with no options.  I remember once I was visiting Florida during a hurricane and everything closed for just a couple days and I panicked in my hotel room because there was nowhere else to go.  Needless to say that isolation is really really really bad for me mentally, and there have been times in the past when I was so depressed I holed up in my apartment, which made everything worse, and I became suicidal.  Now with almost everything closing I feel more trapped than ever and I am concerned about my mental health. Apparently everyone else is too because I couldn't get any appointments to see someone for weeks, which doesn't help too much right now.  I understand why we are doing what we are, but I don't know how I'm going to get through. In the past when I'm mentally pretty rough I've always gotten through by doing things I love like eating at my favorite spots, going shopping, going to the gym, and just going out and being around people so I'm not isolated in my house.  Now I don't even have the options to do that and I'm really worried.  I don't even have anything to keep me occupied during the weekdays, I am in between jobs and was supposed to start my new job last week but of course my start date got pushed back because of all this and now I may not be starting until April-May.

Does anybody have any strategies for maybe overcoming or dealing with these feelings, or things I can still do where I can get out but won't be a risk to others or be violating some sort of restrictions? I'll be in Colorado for the next few weeks so I figured I could go hiking when the weather is nice, but after hearing that Miami closed PUBLIC beaches, I'm terrified they'll take this option away too and close public outdoor space and implement some sort of ""stay inside your home unless you're at the grocery store or else you go to jail"" thing.  I know this sounds selfish right now but I'm pretty worried about myself and I don't know how to get through, and my parents aren't helping much at all.  My friends are all in different states at the moment so I don't have anybody other than my parents to hang out with even at each other's homes and stuff.  Any ideas or coping mechanisms are so appreciated, more specifically to deal with this trapped feeling that I seem especially sensitive to and triggered by.

&#x200B;

TLDR; struggling not with anxiety about virus itself, but about feeling 'trapped' due to a situation I was in about 6 years ago. ever since have been super panicky any time I feel physically or mentally trapped and it tanks my mental health, which is already shaky. looking for ideas for coping mechanisms or things to do that I'll still be allowed to do that may help. i do know i also need to talk to someone about this, but unfortunately therapists are in short supply it seems when people are panicking and I haven't been able to get an appt.",11,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fju7hh/help_with_strategies_to_alleviate_feeling_trapped/

Despite my pleas with them, they left to go to Arizona for five days. I at least got them all set for groceries just in case they have to stay inside. My parents are in their 60s and my Mom just turned  60 and she's a smoker. :( My concern for her is through the roof but surprisingly enough I'm still calm myself. 

I'll be thinking of them all week. They bought some lysol wipes to bring on board and I have told them over and over again to wash their hands daily. I really hope Arizona is safe for them. 

I dread this but I've found peace with myself as selfish as that is given my age and my overall health.",10,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgoj15/i_just_wanted_to_quickly_pop_in_to_say_hello_to/

fkrk2p,COVID19_support,I'm kinda afraid to die...,3/18/2020 23:42,"I'm into the autist spectrum. I'm 29 but I'm obese. BMI 43. I don't have neither hypertension or diabetes, just insulin resistance, fairly controlled with metformin. I don't smoke and I don't drink. I'm doing some kind of caloric restriction now, and I can see the pounds shedding down, but I'm still far from my self imposed goal of reducing my weight by 10%. I consider myself to have a pretty strong inmune system. I rarely get sick, but now I think its because I kinda practiced social isolation since I'm kinda introverted.

Even tho my own physician has said that I'm not in more danger than a healthy guy, I'm still scared of contracting the goddamn virus and develop a complication. I'm afraid to die. And I also afraid to need mechanical ventilation. I had a bad experience with my first endoscopy. I literally woke up in the middle of the procedure and I had to endure it.  I can imagine the pain that means to have a tube inside you insuflating air.

Today I had to break my self imposed quarantine to buy food for my dog and my family. We are fairly stocked right now. The outbreak is still concentrated in the west part of my city (Santiago of Chile) but I was pretty nervous anyways. I barely could avoid the people walking towards me. Ended applying disinfectant to all the things I bought, and took a long shower with loads of soap. I even ended washing my mouth with soap and water because I stupidly kissed a newly bought metformin box. Some times I really do stupid crap.

This shit is taking my mental health to a new level. I never had that level of anxiety before. I consider myself a pretty much rational person... except when the shit takes to extremes like this. Every day I'm watching conflicting info. This is like a cold with a particular high (but not measles high) virulence. and relatively low mortality that looks high because we don't have complete epidemiological data yet. But they are selling it to me like it is the Black Death and we are all gonna to die.

What can do? I kinda want to continue to loss weight and do useful things while our familiar self-imposed quarantine lasts. But I think the anxiety will eat away any motivation.",7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fkrk2p/im_kinda_afraid_to_die/
fkds0w,COVID19_support,Questions about specifics and indirect effects,3/18/2020 5:46,"So I can’t seem to find consistent info anywhere. Asking here to get a general consensus. Going to make it listed because most are unrelated to each other and would be hard to answer in paragraph form on your part:

1. Even though this isn’t that deadly, how ruined is the global economy likely going to be? Everywhere it has hit has seen a massive drop in the economy/stock market. Are we about to hit the greatest recession of our lives?

2. (Assuming we are already on a flat curve) Is it better for everyone to avoid getting it altogether or should people slowly accept getting it? A vaccine won’t be ready for over a year, and it could adapt for all we know. Is it better for people in low risk demographics to expose themselves to it later down the road so they build an immunity? Or is your best bet to avoid it forever?

3. Given how contagious it is, is it safe to assume that 80%+ of people in the infected countries will have it at some point? Or is there a way to fully halt it and let the virus die? Is that too unrealistic?

4. Do you really get sick, feel better, and get sick again? Or is this a myth. I had symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, shakes, headache, dry throat. Now I feel a bit better. I’ve been told it can happen this way and in a few days I’ll feel worse again

5. Will everyone basically go bankrupt? There’s no way everyone will be able to afford rent/bills with no jobs. Even if utility companies are diverting charges, you’ll still have to pay it off eventually, right?

6. How long (in your opinion, obviously you can’t know for sure) until we see the assumed recession end? Will jobs really be that hard to find for a long time? Will the market be down for decades?

7. I know the dangers to high risk groups. But other than that is there any information that is known that is leading to us going full lock down? Obviously it’s common sense to be extremely careful, but assuming I did/do actually have it, it isn’t that bad (knock on wood). I’ve seen so many reports saying it’s not even as bad as the flu.

fgxtie,COVID19_support,Spooked after attending soccer game last Saturday,3/11/2020 22:16,"First off, let me say that I'm glad this group exists, because I've been bottling a lot of these feelings inside for the past few days, and being able to let them out in a forum where others understand what I'm feeling is a good and necessary thing.

I'm 48 years old, married to an amazing woman who gave birth to our son last October. (We weren't planning on procreating, but we're happy he's here.) I'm in fairly good health and try to eat as healthy as I can, though I am susceptible to cold and flu bugs. I caught the swine flu in 2009, which was a little rough, but I lived through it, and I haven't missed a flu shot since. That said, I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, so ""respiratory virus with no cure or vaccine"" gets to me a bit. 

The first novel coronavirus case in my area was reported last week, and it was reported that the guy who had it had visited the nursing home in Kirkland where it broke out and returned to the area in late February. I tried not to freak out about it and started washing my hands more thoroughly. My son was in the NICU for 2 1/2 weeks, so my wife and I know all about proper thorough hand-washing. 

Here's where my psyche started going downhill. Several of the major hobbies I've developed over the last two decades involve close contact with other people. One of them is sports fandom. I'm a member of my local soccer club's supporters' group. 

Last Saturday, I attended our club's home opener. It was a big tailgate party with a giant grill, lots of food out on tables, and a good-sized group of people close together around a couple of tents. At first, I was happy to see everyone, but then it hit me -- if any one of these people contracted and started incubating the coronavirus without realizing it, it could easily infect *all* of us. Sunlight might be the best disinfectant, but it can only do so much.

I tried my best not to show how spooked I was by that thought. I washed my hands thoroughly before the game, at halftime, and after the game. I also avoided touching my face. For a few points during that 90 minutes, I reminded myself that this might be the only time I get to bang on that bass drum all year, so I better do it like there won't be another game.  

Still, the more I watched everyone chanting and partying, the more spooked I got. I couldn't help but think what might happen if I caught this bug and spread it to my wife and son. Yes, the chances of any of us needing to go to an ICU are low, but I've been on both sides of enough bad beats in Texas Hold 'Em games to know the chance is still there. 

What's more, I started thinking about my parents, both in their 70s, both suffering from various ailments. What happens if I inadvertently bring this virus to their house? Chances are they *won't* survive it, especially if local hospitals get overrun and doctors here have to do what doctors in Italy have done and decide who gets the available treatment. I don't want to be the disease vector that turns my parents into statistics.

Again, I'm taking precautions now. I'm working from home (which I've been doing for years already, so no worries there), washing my hands *a lot*, not touching my face (which makes me feel like I have *the itchiest face known to man*), keeping my phone clean, and not going out unless I have to. That's for me and mine.

Still, our state government is only telling the sick and elderly to avoid going out. Thousands of people are still going to sporting events. The NCAA Tournament is showing no signs of being canceled or played behind closed doors like Italian soccer games. Pro leagues are formulating plans to protect players, but not fans. Lots of my friends are still planning on tailgating and shouting in the stands this coming Saturday, while I'm sitting here quietly hoping the season gets suspended for the sake of everyone's health.

I can't help but think that we're already too late, that something plainly horrible is coming to America in the next 2-3 weeks, and that we as a nation are completely unprepared for the chaos that will ensue. I'm prepared to bunker down for a while if things go pear-shaped, but missing chances to let loose with my fellow supporters is going to be hard as hell -- to say nothing of not being able to go out and travel and do the other things I've always enjoyed doing. I suddenly feel like I've taken things for granted that I shouldn't have, and I can already feel myself turning into a really cranky hermit.

That's my anxiety through all this. Thanks for letting me vent.",8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgxtie/spooked_after_attending_soccer_game_last_saturday/

I am about 95 percent ready for whatever is going to happen I feel. 

However there has been one burning thing that I have been wanting to talk about. I know you can't give me any medical advice or anything like this but does being overweight but not suffering from health problems still lead to severe disease and possibly death?

I'm in my mid-20s and I am overweight and I'm not the most athletic person out there. I've been trying to lose weight and eat a more balance diet since last year but it can be hard at times. My question is for those who have been following covid-19, given how nearly 40 percent of the population of the U.S. is overweight or obese does that mean there will be a higher death rate for us all? I don't have any diabetes, no heart problems that I am aware of, I don't smoke, every year when I go in for a yearly physical I'm told to lose weight but they check my vitals. I don't have any high blood pressure, no high cholesterol (though I do tend to eat not so good choice of foods),  and I'm just told to lose a few pounds and I'll be okay. 

Do I at least have somewhat of a chance with this?

TLDR: I'm in my mid 20s, overweight but not obese and not diabetic or suffering from any known compilations and I have low cholesterol and normal heart rate.

How do I keep myself and others from getting the virus if someone living with us has the virus?,3/17/2020 22:48,"My mum just got sick. Only a running nose, so hopefully just a common cold. But my brother still has to go to work and is generally not taking it seriously enough. Touching his face constantly, forgetting to wash his hands before touching food. He has to deal with many different people at work and it's only a matter of time until he gets the virus unless his workplace closes first.

I'm currently freaking out. I'm angry, I can't sleep, can't eat, can't relax, having panic attacks when I read the news. I have no idea what to do anymore. I wasn't able to convince my brother to stay home, but I'll try again. What can I say to my brother to convince him to stay home?

Sorry for this rambling, I just need to vent. Maybe somebody has an idea on what I can do next? What can I do to keep my mother from getting the virus if we assume my brother has it already? I'm sanitizing door handles and stuff, keeping my distance to everyone. Are there any news about the virus staying on objects and spreading without being close to an affected person?

Does it spread just like a common cold? If I'm generally good at not catching a cold when someone is sick at home, do I have the same chances of avoiding covid 19? I've heard that it's less efficient than the flu at spreading, is that actually true?

What about dishes, how can I make sure that the dishes we use aren't affected? Does it help to wash it with hot water before using it? I wasn't able to find any informations about this other than from blogs and forums that I wouldn't trust.

fjbt54,COVID19_support,Depression and thoughts of suicide during COVID distancing.,3/16/2020 8:32,"This is at least the third or fourth time in as many hours that I’m crying and don’t know what to do. In normal times, I’m fairly introverted by nature and enjoy the fact that my job lets us work from home once a week and has a relaxed environment as a perk. But now I’m so unsure and beyond freaked out by all the news, panic, and speculation from everyone from news anchors to doctors to people on other subs and on Facebook pretending they’re experts. 

My company is now mandating work from home for the next two weeks unless your job can’t be done from home. My boss has instituted a daily video call with the team to check in and talk about priorities for the day/week. Even with that and generally appreciating the remote work perk that existed before this, I just can’t imagine not being onsite for two weeks and not physically seeing my team. 

I also work part time in season for a minor league baseball team. My job is only during home games. No baseball now means I may have to sacrifice a summer of secondary income, especially since MLB’s outlook keeps changing from “reassess in two weeks” to “maybe it’ll start in May” to “no games until June.” I am devastated. I love my job (selling 50/50 to support a local charity) and my boss and the fans I normally interact with. That has all been taken from me. I take pride in my work there; I’ve been selling the 50/50 since 2016. If I was just a baseball fan, it would suck to live without going to Yankees games, but it would be more manageable. Losing my work just hurts more even if it is only part time and I have my regular full time job. 

I just joined a community service group but our meetings for the month are canceled. Luckily we didn’t cancel a service project we have planned for the end of this month. 

Pretty soon, I’m sure all restaurants will be closed. All movie theaters. I can’t watch hockey now even since that’s postponed and maybe even done for the year. I am Catholic and went to church today, but I fear soon churches will be the next thing shuttered and I won’t even have my faith or the comfort of attending physical Masses. (Yes I know some churches live stream and you can watch TV Mass in my area from the diocese cathedral but it doesn’t compare to being in a church with a community.) 

I have struggled with suicidal thoughts and worst case thinking before, and now I want to die all over again. With no positive outlets aside from work and it just being me and my apartment and TV if our governor (PA) forces everything to close, I don’t see a lot of hope. Hell I even went to the store just now and not being able to find pork or hot dog buns because the shelves were so bare just made me feel crappier. Right now, it feels like everything I know and care about is gone, and I just don’t know how I can go about doing better.",7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fjbt54/depression_and_thoughts_of_suicide_during_covid/

I am feeling terrified from the fact that I could be stuck in the UK for months without a chance to visit my family and I miss them so much.

Everyone else so far has been telling me to stay in the UK and not be selfish but I really don't know what to do.

From my experience traveling this route at this time, bus is pretty empty, around 5 people, could be even less, the airport is empty between 3am and 7am and thats when my flight is. I only worry about the plane ride itself.

ive seen a post of annonymus person that explains their problems with anxiety and the coronavirus situation and they explain that they had thoughts of diferent scenarios of armagedon or end of the world and i have a point to say to everyone:
people with anxiety belive in this beacuse of pression or fear yes fear of loosing something (like loved ones) and i think the help they need is someone to hear them and just like comfort them beacuse these toughts cant fully go away and we have those type of problems (like my tachycardia for example or suicidal thoughts)
comfort for my anxiety homies is really important beacuse if they get out of the hole they are trapped in they can be more understanding and help other anxiety homies that are struggling with problems.

I was already at the end of my rope, can't-take-this-anymore from my once-again-spiraling depression and anxiety since November. And that was just from life, in general. 

Now theres *this*

Putting aside all the future fears of death, economic collapse, and prolonged stir-crazy, putting aside the short-term fears of *oh god, I have to wake up tomorrow and do this all over again*, there's the midrange: my job. At a grocery store.

On one hand, we're not losing customers like so many other places! On the other hand...so. many. customers. My department (deli) wasnt hit as hard, but with all the talk about cancelling large gatherings, it's hard not to think: what about us? How many people did I talk to, walk by, breathe by? What about my coworkers? There were people pulling double shifts, standing at checkstands, stocking shelves, all in the thick of it. 

I'm not in a high risk group myself, but getting really sick still sucks even when you don't die. And spreading it to people, worsening the problem, yeah, thats a fear. 

So, I guess, I don't know what to do. I need money. With the economy heading downward, I need money bad. But my workplace is basically a petri dish with bad radio music. Why is this considered okay? People talk about shelves being stripped bare, but not about who had to fill them up again. 

I just...I don't even know. I don't know what I'm asking about.

They are both in their 70’s, my mom has several conditions that put her at high risk. They are taking things more seriously than some people I’m seeing (like sanitizing and washing hands, my dad wipes down his steering wheel when he needs to leave the home, they disinfect, etc), but they refuse to buy more groceries, or let my husband help by doing their errands and dropping things on the porch. my mom can not wrap her mind around not being able to see my daughter. I’ve tried to delicately say “hey mom, children don’t seem to be getting sick but they think they can pass this on to people easily, like grandparents, and that makes us nervous”. She just kind of brushes it off, “ok so we won’t see her this weekend, but what about next??”. Any advice or informative links on what to show the elderly to make them understand they need to stay home?? Or ideas on how to broach to my parents they may not be able to see their grandkid for awhile? I’m trying to explain to my parents we need to do social distancing, but they seem like they are taking it personally?? We live a few hrs from Seattle, and despite that people are still acting annoyed school is cancelled, paired with sunny weather everything “feels normal”.  If anything I’m looking for other people who are facing the same issue. Be well, everyone ❤️

He lives alone and has been on leave from work since his transplant.

I live and work about three hours away from my dad. I live in a busy metro area and confirmed COVID-19 cases are now being declared in county I live in. Since the transplant, I go to my dad’s four days a week (Saturday through Tuesday) and work in the office in the metro area three days a week. I am his only caretaker and the only person who he spends time around - with the exception of a homecare nurse who takes his vitals twice a week. 

As of yesterday, my workplace is allowing me to work remotely entirely (meaning three days from my apartment), with the exception of going to job sites. I work in the civil and environmental engineering industry.

I’m terrified of my dad catching COVID-19 and losing him. We were so excited and hopeful when he got the kidney transplant. It was great to see him excited and mobile and not exhausted and sleeping all the time.

I’m taking all the precautions to wash my hands and avoid people as much as possible (other than my significant other who lives with me). I plan to fill multiple pill boxes when I visit this weekend.

fhs0qp,COVID19_support,"Grow something to make yourself feel better now, and provide for yourself and others later.",3/13/2020 9:54,"I'm fortunate enough to have a big yard out in a rural area.  I have a greenhouse and was already planning on enlarging my raised bed garden this year.  We also have a few chickens.  Our little retirement farm, we just love it - easing into new skills, we were both city people.  Well, our little farm just got a whole lot bigger.

The single most important thing I do to reduce my anxiety over the pandemic is to figure out what I'm gonna grow in my garden, where I'm gonna grow it, and getting everything ready to grow it.   I sort through my seed packets and plot almost daily how I'm gonna maximize what I can grow.  I've cleaned out the greenhouse, ordered more seeds, a hydroponic rack for salad stuff, and starter pots (do you know Amazon delivers big bags of potting soil?  the drivers must hate me), and now I'm waiting a couple more weeks for it to warm up enough to plant.

We also were gonna double the size of our chicken flock this year.  Instead, we quadrupled it and ordered 40 baby chicks for next month.  I've already set up the brooder and nursery in a corner of the greenhouse.  In seven months, I'll have 3 or 4 dozen eggs a day, and the extra cockerels to eat.  (And THAT is another learning curve...)

Hey, I know a lot of people don't have much space to grow things in the city, but even a few container pots in the window or a table hydroponic grower can give you a fresh source of greens and herbs pretty quickly.  And growing something you can eat is SO rewarding.  It just feels good to see a little seed transform itself into food under your guidance.

So the way I figure it, we're all spending all of our time just thinking about surviving the next couple months.  Actually, I'm more worried about the people in my neighborhood being frightened and hungry in the aftermath, with no way to get fresh, healthy food to feed their family.  I think that with what I am doing RIGHT NOW I'll be able to help a lot with veggies and eggs later on.

Official government advice is just to carry on and only isolate if you have symptoms.

Today I sent my boss an email saying that due to my family having high-risk health conditions, and the new evidence of community spread, I would like to work from home for the foreseeable future. There is no reason why I shouldn't be able to do this as I can do my entire job from home. There is just pressure to show face in the office as it's a cultural norm.

fd099q,COVID19_support,Freaking out,3/4/2020 3:48,"This is going to be long and disconnected and irrational but I just need a place to ramble, sorry... (potentially triggering)

I keep swinging back and forth between ""it's fine, it's not going to be that bad"" and feeling like I'm completely losing my mind. I've always had paranoia about mainly three things: myself or my loved ones dying suddenly, societal chaos/collapse, and the apocalypse. Now after years of trying to tell myself I'm being irrational, it seems all these fears are coming to life. It doesn't help that the apocalypse one has to do with my paranoia (maybe better termed as a delusion?) that we're living in the biblical end times. I'm not even that religious of a person, but I've never been able to get that out of the back of my head, and things like this bring it right back to the forefront

I've prepped a little bit but we don't have much extra money. And I want to tell my parents (I don't live with them) to prep, but my mom and brother have serious anxiety issues too and I don't want to scare them by emphasizing too much that they should prep. Ugh. I don't know if I can trust my family to self-quarantine if it came down to it, anyway

When I'm super anxious, sensations like touch and loud noises really set me off and make me feel like I'm out of control, so being a SAHM to a 5 month year old (who loves to shriek) is really hard. Obviously I'm still taking good care of him, but it's so hard to distract myself from the real world when he's constantly demanding attention. I am SO thankful though that the virus barely affects children. Him getting sick was one of my biggest fears initially, and I know I would be in a much worse place if I still thought he was vulnerable

My fiancé's job involves going into dozens of other people's home every day, and people around here don't practice very good hygiene. I'm so scared he's going to catch the virus...both for him and me, and also I'm scared he's going to unknowingly spread it to his customers while still asymptomatic (a lot of his customers are elderly and/or sickly). And he can't just not work because we're barely staying afloat financially as it is.

I'm going to visit my parents 8 hours away this weekend and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to see them, but I'm scared to even use the rest stops because of the germs. Being pregnant and having a newborn made me into somewhat of a germophobe, and this is making it soooo much worse. I'm starting to get scared to even get packages because of the virus being potentially spread by the originator or people involved in the shipping. And I'm also so so scared that this could be the last time I see my family (my parents are in their early 60's)

Sometimes I almost wish I'd just get the virus now if it's inevitable anyway and be cured and have immunity before the hospital system becomes completely overloaded. The idea that I or my family members could need ventilation but be unable to get it is terrifying. Especially since I live in a rural area, so the medical care isn't the best in the first place. It's better where my parents live, but there's also a lot more people so more overloaded hospitals...not sure which is worse. I'm so angry the US government seems to be barely doing anything. Us not knowing much about the virus is killing me

I can't go to therapy (wouldn't now because of germs even if I had access to it) and I don't have medication so I don't know what to do. Therapy wouldn't make a difference anyway. I don't someone to tell me how to be less anxious, I want someone to convince me that everything is going to be fine. I just want to scream and cry. Sometimes I hit myself just to let it out. Knowing anxiety lowers immunity makes me even more anxious 

I've always been a super anxious person, but all my past anxieties seem so silly and trivial compared to this. And before this my life was finally looking like it was going in a good direction for once...

A cytokine storm is where your immune system over-reacts to the virus. You get to feeling better then bam. Your immune system starts sending cells to fight the pneumonia in the lungs and then you have multiple organ failure and you go septic.


How is this combated? What are the chances of getting hit by this storm when dealing with a case of coronavirus?

I need to be doing something to help, or my mental health will be destroyed. I can’t sit back and do nothing. 

I saw on the news a woman doing grocery pickups free of charge for elderly and disabled. I’ve seen people volunteering to watch kids for families that have to go to work. 

There are certain things I won’t do, like watching children, because of my chronic health conditions. I have autoimmune conditions and I’m not as healthy as my peers (33 years old). With this in mind, what can I do?

I just began sewing masks for myself. I found a wonderful tutorial on using 3m home filters to use in masks. I’ve been told it’s the same material that is used in the 3m n95 masks. I thought I could make masks for those that are compromised and were not able to purchase a N95 mask. But I don’t know how I would reach these people or if they would even want it. 

I have an AA degree in psychology (not much, but it’s something). I try to reach out to people online when I can. Not sure how helpful I am to talk to. But, I am willing to offer my time to people that need some emotional support.

I think doing grocery pickups would be fairly safe for me, if I wore my mask, gloves and goggles. I’m willing to take minimal risks.

This is what I’ve come up with. Any other skills I have are probably useless for this situation.

I guess  I knew this sort of shut down to everyday life was inevitable, though I am still not coping very well. I am a college senior in the last semester of my undergraduate who has been looking forward to this spring/summer as the best time of my life. I go to school full time, live in residence, and work two jobs on my university campus, as well as participates in lots of societies and clubs. I was looking forward to graduating this spring and walking across the stage in front of my family (I’ve even had a countdown on my phone for 4 years, lol!) and was planning on going on my first ever trip to Scotland by myself in April. I had my dream summer job lined up at a music festival and was planning on getting my very first apartment. Now, my life has completely fallen down around me. My university has been shut down so I’ve lost my home, my job, my graduation, all the galas and dinners I was looking forward to attending, all of my extracurriculars, and had to cancel my trip. The festival I was supposed to be working at also got cancelled, leaving me with no job lined up for the summer and nowhere to live. On top of this, all of my friends that I have made during my time at school had to abruptly go home without goodbyes, most of whom I may never see again.

Seeing France and the U. K. refuse to test people that aren't in need of hospitalization, then seeing the system that my own country boasts, leaves me very anxious at the prospect of what's to come.

To top it all off, people that went and came back from coronavirus-stricken countries are being less than genuine. For instance, the director of the clinic for skin diseases, even after having had symptoms arise, didn't go for a test, nor did she notify the people with whom she interacted that she'd recently returned from Italy. She went so far as to threaten people that were suspicious, until someone called her in. Now, there are ca. 200 people in isolation because of her.Additionally, in my hometown, there are rumors that a few teachers also came back from Italy while not reporting their departure or subsequent return to the authorities, and going against regulations to quarantine for 2 weeks.

fgiyv0,COVID19_support,Possibility of a Q&A session?,3/11/2020 2:59,"I'm new to reddit so if this isn't the place feel free to remove it. 

**TL;DR:** Student going into medical with history of hospital work and basic virus education, would like to open FAQ thread tomorrow to break down concerns along with other health workers who might be interested in giving insight. Will not give medical advice, just want to help provide more info to general public.  

I've been seeing a lot of similar concerns among posts here and was wondering the possibility of having a FAQ thread where people might be able to access more vague and less personal answers for COVID-19. As I've stated in prior posts I'm not a medical professional but I do have work history in hospitals and have taken a microbiology course that covered a good base on viruses and have had to do research on a prior coronavirus (SARS). 

I by no means intend to provide medical advice as I am just a student but I would like to help provide a break down to the best of my ability of people's concerns as I think a huge problem of the anxiety is that a lot of information isn't broken down for the general public. I'm also sure there are other medical students or workers that would like to help make this as less scary as possible for people.

I've been finding myself addressing a lot of similar concerns but I do have to go into work/class today so if it's allowed I'd like to open a thread with Q&A so people with similar concerns might be able to find answers in a more timely and organized manner.

As I've said previously I am only a student and I cannot speak for all countries, cases, nor can I provide medical advice by any means but I would really like to help break down concerns into more manageable information to help people stay calm with caution. If there is an interest and this is allowed I will be able to dedicate a good part of my day tomorrow to managing a thread and providing sources (something I'd have difficulty with today) .

Then I read that on the street there is no danger but if we are closer than 2 metres and in the same space longer than 15 minutes - then there is danger of infection (even if the other person has no symptoms).

fd22hn,COVID19_support,Glad to have found this Subreddit,3/4/2020 5:42,"Not sure if I'll get the opportunity to post this, but in any case, I wanted to say that I'm glad I've found this subreddit. I've only recently started updating myself on everything going on with the virus and since that point, it's started to freak me out. I've had about two mini panic attacks over it and for the past 2-3 weeks, I haven't had much of an appetite at all. I've been going about my daily routines as normal for the most part, but if I even hear someone talk about the virus or see an ad or video about it, my body just freezes up and I am just overcome by a sense of dread for hours on end sometimes. The only thing that seems to help keep things off my mind is sleeping (taking naps) or speaking with friends who have all ensured me that things are going to be fine and I just need to stop worrying about it.

I just have so many other things going on as well (outside of worrying about the virus) and I'm supposed to be turning 25 in 2 days which for the first time in my life, I'm not excited about. I've been worrying myself to death about the virus but I just found this sub last night and it's nice to know that I'm not going crazy and that I'm not alone and that there are others feeling the same as me. I know the chances for my age group to catch the virus (or at least get critically ill from it) are slim, but I just can't help but worry about it anyway seeing as there are still so many things we don't know about the virus. Plus, I am still living with my parents due to financial issues and they are in their 50s so naturally, I have to worry about them as well. I like to think things will be fine as I've never been a sickly person and my immune system has been pretty good to me all this time as I rarely get sick from anything at all (nor do I have any underlying medical conditions that I know of.)

It's just been such a huge relief to read what everyone is saying here and trying to put things into a perspective that is more positive than I've been able to do for weeks. I just really hope that things turn out okay for everyone and that this whole ordeal will blow over as soon as possible.

I have suffered from hypochondria, anxiety, and OCD for many years. All of the schools around me closed for the foreseeable future (at least a month), many businesses, etc as more and more cases are being diagnosed in the area. Being a hypochondriac, going to the Dr. is my safe haven and I’m supposed to go Thursday for a routine follow up/we’ll visit. My wife is going to the Dr. Thursday for a follow up exam from a car accident so I feel like if she goes and gets it I’m going to anyways. She isn’t nearly as worried like I am and wants to live her life. We’re both in the low risk group as far as age goes. She’s 29. I’m 34. No pre existing conditions, non smokers, etc. 
last Thursday I developed a scratch in my throat. Stuffy nose, sinuses plugged etc. Didn’t think much of it. Progressed into post nasal drip over the weekend which enhanced the sore throat. Small little coughs maybe 5-10x a day since—Probably because I’m thinking about it and have the scratchy throat. Jittery. Shaky. Tight chest. Most likely anxiety I’m told. Had chills here and there but never a fever. Called our local Coronavirus hotline and they weren’t concerned enough to put me past questioning into triage etc. just said to keep an eye out for the big 2–fever and breathing problems. I have terrible allergies and get sinus colds this time of year on an annual basis. I just can’t kick the feeling that I got it from someone at work, the store, or anywhere. I’m isolating myself from people. Not wanting to see friends. I’m afraid I’ll pass it along to my wife and kids (healthy so far). It’s literally crippling me. I spoke with my psychiatrist over the phone to work on medication. Going to try and do the same with upcoming counseling appointments instead of in person. Trying to do the right things. Just doesn’t feel like enough right now. It’s tough the Dr is what relieves my anxiety quite often but now it’s the trigger. I don’t know whether to go on TH or not. Sorry I’m all over the place. Just a way to process I guess. The fear of permanent lung damage, being sick in general, is just overwhelming  right now, as it is for many. I’m sure it’s the common cold/sinus cold  that I’ve had but I just can’t stop thinking otherwise.

fjaegc,COVID19_support,Have been positive – but now I feel completely depressed,3/16/2020 7:01,"I really just need to vent. I've been pretty calm about the whole thing for a couple weeks now, but in the last two days I can't shake my anxiety and depression.

I live in the US and I come from a family that has a history of anxiety, germaphobia, and OCD. My mother is agoraphobic and works from home (grateful for that right now), and my father is a SEVERE germaphobe, on the verge of being agoraphobic and really should be seeking therapy. I'm a 21-year-old only child, and right now I'm in school and am able to be preoccupied with all my schoolwork and hobbies. The lockdown gives me a chance to work on my music, study for some exams I have to take this summer, learn to sew, paint, read, exercise, etc.

As positive as all that is, I can't shake my anxiety. I had a day about two weeks ago where I lied in bed for hours unable to get up because I was having anxiety about the virus. Since then, I've been feeling better, reading a lot of articles about it, and keeping busy. But in the US, things blew completely out of proportion in literally three days. Since then, people have been panicking to the extreme, especially my parents. This is the worst kind of thing to happen for parents like mine. I feel worse for them than I do for myself.

My personal concerns lie with others. I have the means to not leave the house for months and I am grateful, but others don't. I'm worried about people and children who don't have food or a stable home, I'm worried about the repercussions of this and how hard it might be for me or my family to find work once this is over. I'm concerned about my extended family yes, but I am also very concerned for my boyfriend (who is still going out and still has to work). He has severe depression, bipolar, BPD. I'm concerned that he will a.) get the virus and not care, not do anything to get better or b.) will finally be told he can't go to work and therefore can no longer afford his therapy, his car insurance, etc. (he works at a grocery store so this is very unlikely, but it could happen). Every time I tell him to just stay home, he won't. He can't do that and even if he could, he probably wouldn't.

Yes this was possibly the year AND the summer I was going to go on a few trips, graduate, see one of my favorite bands, POSSIBLY get engaged... and everyone has selfish concerns during a time like this. But I am so worried for other people. I'm oversensitive and I can't bare the thought of people not having food or shelter. Like I mentioned, I'm also incredibly worried about my boyfriend. My father (because of his own issues) has disallowed me from seeing my boyfriend and going to work, which I agree with to an extent, but I miss him and really hope he doesn't get the virus. I can't even just get up and go somewhere because (perfect timing) my car battery died and can't afford to replace it right now obviously. Not that I want to anyway, I have my own issues in the past with germaphobia.

Luckily I have a therapist at school who is still keeping our weekly appointments through phone. I'm a huge yogi and have been able to do lots of yoga during this. There's so many things I'm grateful for and that's why I've been feeling relatively calm... but not anymore. Now this all feels nightmareish. Any good news to calm me down would be appreciated, even though I've probably read it before :(",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fjaegc/have_been_positive_but_now_i_feel_completely/

I stay home, I only leave to walk my dog on a field, a meadow, with no people on it. I miss people, I can't touch my boyfriend, I can't take a train and visit him, hug him, kiss him. spending my days with my parents is not the most fun thing ever, but at least I'm not completely isolated from any human contact.

I miss my friends, all schools are closed and they were only closed yesterday... but just the thought that I won't be able to see them for weeks. it's only the beginning and I'm already struggling. ever since January Ive been experiencing this inthebackofthehead anxiety, hidden but showing symptoms. started suffering from migraines, thought it was school stress but I figured out it's the fear of that virus. it's all I hear about, it's everywhere, when I was passing people on the street I heard them talking about it, when I turned on the TV it was there, when I tuned in the radio the updates of increasing numbers were broadcasted every 30 minutes.

I'm tired of it, I get angry when someone talks about it, I hate it. and even tho I do, I still look up new info before bed, just like I've been doing since January, a daily update. it's like I'm the only one allowed to know, like no one else is allowed to talk about it in my world. it's crazy what it does to you, and my country is not even largely affected yet.

I've struggled with depression most of my life, ive got better, was happy for a brief moment, then this came and took it away. I'm not gon list all the things I struggle with mentally, but when you top them off with fear of a global pandemic it really amounts to something a young adult should not have to deal with.

I just came down with a fever which is somewhat normal for me (I get random fevers maybe once every two months) but I just can’t help but be paranoid I’m sick, even though I come into contact with the same select people everyday, none of who are sick or interacted with the infected in anyway. 

Anyways, I just want to know if there’s anyone else out there who is sharing my pain in Montgomery County and is scared shitless like me. I feel so alone in my fears, my friends, family, and boyfriend aren’t taking it seriously and neither is the township or my college (hasn’t even addressed the virus yet, meanwhile other colleges are shutting down).

I’m not sure if I’m at a larger risk, and if I am what courses of action I can take, since I already wear face masks (the news says are useless) and wash my hands 8 times a day.

fcaded,COVID19_support,"A journalist in panic isn't a good idea, is it",3/2/2020 18:51," Guys, a Bulgarian journalist calling for help here. It's been almost a month since I started reading and researching absolutely on my own news about COVID-19. It wasn't overwhelming at first, not at all. I really deeply thought it was going to follow strictly the outcome with SARS. Now I am constantly digging in medical journals, pharmaceutical issues, clinical trials and again numbers and numbers of the death toll, statistics and you know. First line problem for me is my family's absolute resistance to even hear me. Both my partner and I are journalists, he is a hypochondriac, which, believe me, doesn't help at all. I happen to not be medically educated but have been having a vast interest in medicine for more than a decade now. This does not help either as being familiar with terminology, such as ""ground-glass opacity"" only makes me even more depressed. Second thread of my problem is my own mother, who has many conditions, including those, cited in specific researches to be the most serious and contributing to the CFR rates. Third is the knowledge how the healthcare system here works and how the mentality of the nation will completely (as it is at the time being) downplay the situation when it becomes a situation. And forth, maybe most important - I am a mother if 2. I know I am not panicked yet. But while most of you (I presume) CAN use some will and common sense to escape a certain percentage of what news look like, I can't - it's my job, maybe my moral debt to the society to keep people who are not capable of using the media instruments well informed and informed correctly.

fbpu4v,COVID19_support,An American living in Shanghai's story,3/1/2020 13:56,"So, I rarely use reddit, but after having seen so many people freaking out and also spreading false/insensitive information that people actually believe, I decided to find a platform where I could show my perspective. 

Some background - I'm an ethnically Chinese, American citizen that goes to an international high school in Shanghai. I moved there from Boston when I was six.

Recently, we were just about to go on our Chinese new year break. I left school not thinking anything would change, however as you all know, I was very wrong. This was around the time that the virus started to spread to the Eastern parts of China, and in compliance with the Shanghai Education Committee's rules, our school and all other schools in Shanghai, international or local had to cancel school until the 17th of February, my end of season basketball tournament along with it. This of course brought uncertainty to my entire community, and these sneaking suspicions of the virus getting even more out of hand soon became true, as the government then ordered that all the schools would be cancelled until some time in March. This ""time"" in March has still not been announced. This caused my whole family to freak out, as different countries started to close their borders to people who have been in China in the last 14 days. Fearing that we would be somehow trapped, my mom told us to pack our bags and booked a last minute flight to Taiwan, and then left our dog in a pet shop to live in until we would hopefully return.

I know that I'm extremely lucky to be able to first of all live in Shanghai and not Hubei, and second, be able to leave the mainland so easily, especially after hearing some extremely depressing stories of families trapped in Hubei. I wasn't the only person to have this idea to leave mainland ASAP, however, many of my friends decided to stay behind, either because it was an extremely inconvenient time to leave, or because their parents didn't think that the virus was that serious. Now, many countries are not allowing them in, so they are basically stuck in Shanghai, but they are still allowed to go outside, however their activities are limited heavily. After a week in Taiwan, we were supposed to go to Singapore, because my mom's work had an office there, however, the day before we were supposed to leave, Singapore announced that effective the next day, they would not let people who were in China mainland in the last 14 days in. Panicking, we again, booked a last minute flight to Singapore and left as early as possible. 

Now, you might be thinking I'm studying of if I'm studying at all (tbh you probably aren't thinking this), and the answer to that is, my school is doing e-learning - posting the assignments online and having us take pictures of our work and send it into the teachers. This certainly is NOT as good as real school, and I know every single one of my friends and classmates can say the same. Education is being greatly affected, especially for the Juniors and Seniors of all schools. Their SATs and ACTs were cancelled, and all AP tests were postponed. While I am not a Junior or Senior, I can completely understand why all of them are panicking; I have a sister who is a Senior right now. 

My family plans to fly back to Shanghai on the 13th of March, however, the situation is still extremely unstable, and we aren't certain that it's the best option, despite my whole family's homesickness and how we all miss my dog. Now, there are a whole lot of insensitive comments coming around, and at this point, I feel like some people are downplaying the effect of the virus. Children are dying. 20-30 y/o adults are dying. People - its not just the ones who are old that are dying, and despite having a lower chance of dying from the virus if you're younger, you do not want to contract it and give it to your family. There are numerous cases where this virus has sadly wiped out entire families in China, and they just aren't being reported to the mainstream media. I urge people to not spread false and insensitive information, because it just causes more panic, however, do not downplay the potential damage that this virus can cause. Wash your hands, protect yourself in public especially if you are in a risky country, and do not be insensitive, as real people are really suffering from this event. 

P.S. my relatives are doing fine. My grandparents were in America long before the virus and are still there. My uncle and his family went to visit them before the virus, and are also still there. 

TLDR: Im an American living in China and school got cancelled as the virus spread. My family, along with many others left mainland ASAP, but not everyone did and now they are stuck in Shanghai. School is now online learning. People are saying this is no big deal, but it's not only old people that are dying. Stay safe. I miss my dog.",5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fbpu4v/an_american_living_in_shanghais_story/

The mounting stress of having to deal with all the corona virus related news has started to become too much for me to handle. I have anxiety and this pandemic has taken an extensive toll on my mental health and anxiety. This coupled with the fact that my mother recently passed away due to a genetic lung disease has made me very anxious to go to work and potentially catch the disease from the 200+ employees at the office.

My place of employment has provided paid time off to those that are sick, returning from work or have childcare related issues.  Unfortunately, none of these options apply to me. 

My options are 1 of 3; 

1. Call in sick and use a 1 of the sick days I have left - realistically this will be a short term solution and may provide me with the ability to calm down and get everything together to be able to move on
2. Call in and explain my situation and hope that mental health will be covered as an approved covid related time off
3. Call in sick and tell them that my symptoms are similar to covid-19 - I really would hate to be dishonest as I don't want to panic my colleagues at work and feel that it's morally wrong to do this. 

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place though because I can't figure out which route to take. I am new at my place of employment and thus don't want to give my managers too much detail about my private life and current mental health struggles.

More than anything, I need some other opinions and views on a situation my brother and myself are in. It's been a rough 48 hours.

I live in NYC in Queens. As I'm sure a lot of people know already, things are not looking good here. It's been nerve-wracking. My mom asked us to return to our hometown in IL to be out of the way of the virus. She claimed that they don't have any cases where she lives so it's safer to live there and not be in isolation in a major city, and there would be no ""riots"" over food shortages, like she is predicting will happen in NYC if we go on lockdown. She and my father are both in high-risk categories. We told them we wanted to see how things developed over the next few days because we didn't want to take any travel risks and there was still a lot up in the air; my brother's college was still open. This was Thursday. My mother has threatened us by saying she will stay in NYC if we won't go out with her, even though she's high-risk.

This weekend they just showed up at my doorstep with a rental car, expecting us to go to IL the next day. My brother and I have stalled them long enough to try and make a decision.

Brief backstory - my mother has a severe personality disorder. She's extremely obsessive with my little brother and myself and would risk public health if it meant we would be closer or if we moved back to our hometown. Every other phone call I have had with her for the last three years has involved her making up scenarios for us to move back home.  

Guys. I don't want to spread COVID-19. I'm healthy and not showing symptoms, but I know the virus can take a while to become symptomatic. I worked in retail at the start of the NYC outbreak and I have had contact with the general public (obsessively following CDC hygiene guidelines, but still).  My job closed for the week and I could easily isolate myself in Queens. I'm so afraid I might contract it. Leaving the city just seems like an opportunity to possibly infect this small town, my high-risk parents and anyone along the way.

So I've got two parents begging me to travel via car to the Midwest and NYC on the verge of a possible shutdown. 

Any advice? Is anyone under lockdown in a similar city? Is the shutdown bad? Are there any ""riots"" over food? I'm so torn about what to do; I've been crying all day and night. I want to believe they want the best for me but I also want to do what's best for the welfare of other citizens.",5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj1k1m/parents_want_me_to_return_to_the_midwest_from_nyc/
firyv4,COVID19_support,Wedding planned for next weekend - Practical advice and emotional support advice for my friend appreciated,3/15/2020 7:44,"One of my sorority sisters has a wedding planned for next weekend. 200 guest RSVPed, but 30-40 have already told her they aren't coming in the past week. There won't be a lot of back of house support, but I imagine the venue will have at least... 10-15 additional people milling about doing various things? So around 170-180 folks drinking, eating, sweating, dancing, and trying to act like everything is normal.

She's floated the idea of canceling or trying to reschedule, but obviously this is weighing pretty hard. She paid an outlandish amount of $ to have hand sanitizer on every table and is in the process of contacting everyone invited to tell them more about the situation (amount of people attending, what the venue is doing to clean/support, ask them to confirm again if they are coming, ask them not to attend if they have been exposed or are feeling sick, etc). Almost everyone is driving in or already local.

Her city has issued guidance discouraging gatherings over 250, but hasn't formally prohibited them.

If she does decide to have the event, what's the best way to mitigate the potential risks? The venue doesn't seem like they are going to pull the plug (unless directed by the state/city).

Any thoughts appreciated. She's taking it in stride right now (she wanted to elope afterall), but if she decides to cancel I think she'll be really upset and I don't know how to help.

fh8mnl,COVID19_support,"(Venting) We Have Done Everything Right. Our Roommate, However...",3/12/2020 9:47,"I'm on edge because we have a roommate,
 who we love, of course, but who is a walking minefield. He and my fiance go back a long, long way and he's a cool dude but he's also just super oblivious. He also has ""I know everything"" syndrome while being one of the simplest minds I know.

Two weeks ago, I watched as he literally sneezed into my fiance's dinner. He has this absent-minded habit of fiddling with anything that's not his. And I literally just heard him open every cabinet in the kitchen even though he owns no food or cooking implements here. My fiance and I are just sitting here like...wtf. I'm 100% positive he hasn't washed his hands except when he takes a shower, and he spends hours at the gym and parties. 

We have had many serious conversations with him about quarantining and how it's important to keep my fiance safe. It is hard for our roommate to remember conversations (legitimate health issue) so we even began writing him reminders every time he comes over. He just thinks he knows better and doesn't follow them. 

Thankfully, he is not around much bc he hangs out w his girlfriend all the time. But she is constantly around sick people and kids and if neither of them have it by this point, I'd be shocked. 

Every time he visits, my fiance and I lock ourselves in our space and wait until he's gone again. Then, we disinfect with soap/water/disinfecting wipes on anything we think he's touched. That, of course, is a crap shoot in a big house or in a shared kitchen. (We don't share a bathroom with him thank god.)

I'm doing everything I can to protect the man dearest to me but I feel like I'm fighting a massive ignorance monster who puts my fiance at risk every day. It's infuriating. I just am hoping we make it to a day where we can stop living in fear of him. 

Also, does anyone know if the virus can be spread through the air conditioner? Someone told me that today and I think he's full of shit since they dont really ""recycle"" air and the virus is droplet-motivated. But I definitely want the answer. 

Thanks for letting me vent (pun intended?)!

On the nice side: my fiance and I already worked from home and are having a creative revolution with all the excuses to stay in. I'm also becoming so much better at meditating since my daily 10 minutes has quickly become a daily 20. 

Stay healthy and physically/mentally well everyone. You are stronger than you think you are.

fgjc2m,COVID19_support,Should I go to the doctor? Why is there so little information??,3/11/2020 3:21,"Four days ago I flew from San Diego to LAX then to Reno, Nevada. Two of my 12 friends that I spent time in a cabin with in Reno were sick, and 2 days later I was hit with a sickness as well.

* My initial symptoms came on really quick (headache, fever, and chills all within an hour or 2).
* My body temperature is fluctuating all over the place (hot, cold, hot, cold, etc...).
* I have a nasty cough.
* I have a classic runny nose.
* My friend who was sick before me lives in San Diego and hasn't traveled outside of the US recently.
* I already had a cold in mid February and can't recall ever getting sick twice in one year.
* I don't have any trouble breathing.
* I am in my mid 20's and live healthily.

Should I get checked out by a doctor for possible covid-19? I have the symptoms, but because I don't know anyone with confirmed covid-19, so according to the CDC, the answer is no. But this seems like a terrible way to prevent spreading, since you don't always know who you're in contact with. Shouldn't everyone who is sick get tested??

ffk0vb,COVID19_support,Corona panic surrounding new job and trip,3/9/2020 6:03,"Hey guys!  I've been lurking here for a while and realized I could use the support myself right now.  I wasn't super concerned about corona until it hit NYC, where I live, and it's been downhill since then.  I have asthma and I've already been having some breathing difficulties this week, which of course stresses me out. If I were to get the virus on top of my breathing the way it is now I'd be very concerned about myself.  I've been staying home and taking it easy because I'm between jobs, but I'm set to start my new job in Midtown (super crowded) tomorrow.  Not that I'd want to risk my health anyway, but I feel especially pressured to stay healthy right now because my family and I have booked a dream trip in 3 weeks and have thousands of dollars (that unfortunately won't be refundable, even given the current issues) invested.  Not to mention I just really need this trip, I've had a really rough last few months and the only thing that got me through most days was thinking about it, and I really can't handle the thought of not being able to go, or being sick and miserable while there.

It's gotten to the point where I'm having panic attacks about the thought of going out into public, let alone the thought of having to sit at a desk at work surrounded by people whose behaviors/health I have no idea about.  I went downstairs to get mail today and had a panic attack when a few people got into the elevator with me, to the point where I had to get out and then had an immediate breakdown. I tried to go to my workout class this yesterday and had to leave because I had a panic attack about the potential spread there.  My mom suggested I go see a doctor due to my difficulty breathing this week, but I'm terrified about putting myself in such a germ-laden environment.  Overall it's just really not good, and while I do know I need to speak to someone regarding the mental health issues I have going on, I haven't had much luck with that helping in the past.  It's at the point where I'm basically non-functional, I can't leave my apartment without having a full-on breakdown and I've been yelling at my dad on the phone for what seems like ever now because I am just freaking out so much and have so much anger and anxiety and everything. 

I guess I'm just looking for any reassurance, commiseration, or advice.  My big concern is my new job starting tomorrow.  They had originally offered for me to start after my trip and I told them I'd like to start earlier, which I now deeply regret.  I really don't think I'm going to be able to keep it under control having to sit in the office when I'm panicking like this and I really don't want to give a bad impression or start off unable to do my work to the best of my ability.  I feel like I have no control over the situation, I feel like by going in I'll be exposing myself to the great possibility of getting sick and will risk my health and my trip.  It stresses me out that so many places are asking people to work from home but as I'll just be starting I don't have that option at all.  I'm doing everything right, washing hands, using sanitizer, avoiding touching my face, but in an office in Manhattan who knows where everyone else has been, and I can't avoid touching everything and interacting with everyone, and I do have to walk through the city to get to work.  I know employers are being a bit more understanding with things due to this virus thing, would it be terrible if I told them that due to my difficulty breathing right now I'm concerned about my risk and would prefer to start in a few weeks?   I've just about had it, I have been nonstop panicking for days now and I've reached a breaking point today.  I've had to take my emergency panic attack medication (it essentially knocks me out) multiple times, and I can't continue living like this for much longer, let alone start a new job when I'm like this.  I need to stay healthy until my breathing issues clear up and until I've gone on my trip and I feel that by going into the office every day I'm majorly risking that.  Any advice or support is so appreciated!

TLDR; live in NYC and am starting new job in Midtown on Monday. Have been having panic attacks at the thought of even leaving my apt let alone going into an office every day and exposing myself to germs there. Have been having breathing difficulties this week and am nervous about what would happen if I was to get the virus on top of them, and I also have thousands invested in a trip in 3 weeks and I really cannot miss it.  Debating on whether it's okay to ask to push my start date back a few weeks so I can get through these breathing issues and my trip but can't decide if this is too drastic or not.  Also just don't know how to cope with this panic, I struggle with anxiety but have never experienced it to this extent before, I am full-on non functional right now",2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffk0vb/corona_panic_surrounding_new_job_and_trip/

fkp2nh,COVID19_support,Sick right now and nervous,3/18/2020 20:55,"
Last week Saturday (Mar 7) I had a bit of a tingly throat and fatigue/light headed. I bounced back remarkably quickly and on Sunday was virtually asymptomatic again other than feeling a little tired. My colleagues had gone to a conference in the US and were also sick - one of them went to get tested and was negative. I told myself this was likely just a case of stress or paranoia and I was totally fine. I had had my flu shots months ago so not the flu. 

After that my partner got a little ill but I was still fine - he also had a bit of a tingly throat, light headed and fatigue. Within 2 days he was feeling better so we thought ok we just had a mild spell of whatever else was going around (considering there were about 3000 negative tests said the news). I stayed home Monday because I wanted to make sure I was completely asymptomatic before going back to work but didn’t think too much of it because it was literally a one day thing for me.  Tue-thur I went to work and Friday 13 we did a Work from home day and bosses called us to work from home as of then. Weekend and Monday (yesterday) daytime went fine, I went to a few grocery stores but practiced social distancing and used self checkout and sanitized my hand with hand sanitizer after. I also tried cleaning my phone with a wipe and the stores weren’t super busy. 

However Monday (yesterday) late evening out of nowhere 💥 bam, I was warm, throat was weird again and a big headache. Then, I barely slept and moved to the couch in the middle of the night because I was coughing so much and wanted to be a little upright. This morning I puked up clear fluid first thing in the morning. Now I’m coughing, warm (I don’t know my temperature because I don’t have a thermometer but I’m lightly sweaty and warm not sweating buckets). I am fatigued have slept three times today - at 12, 3 and 5pm. I have a runny nose, it’s difficult to breathe only because my throat feels blocked up - I’ve soaked through five paper towels coughing up clear liquid (thankfully not green or yellow right now) and am having vitamin c and a lot of fluids at home to stay hydrated. I can take a deep breath and my chest doesn’t hurt. I heard Coronavirus was a dry cough which my cough sounds dry like it’s a weak dry cough, not a loud chesty one, but I have so much fluid from my nose and Feels like fluid in my throat.

I honestly don’t know what to do like I don’t want to be a burden on the health system as I’m fairly young but I also want to know so I can contact people who I worked with and or stress the importance if I do indeed have it. I’m otherwise relatively healthy - non smoker or vape, low bp, suspected Early onset RA - still doing follow ups for that but nothing diagnosed), I take vitamins daily like zinc and vitamin c and d as well as fish oil capsules, No kidney, liver, thyroid issues. 

We do have assessment centres now but I don’t even know how I’d get there I have no car and wouldn’t want to call a taxi or uber and get anyone sick. I could take the train and try and stay far away from people. I also have to be online for work though. I’m so confused with what to do - what would you do?!

fkn4va,COVID19_support,Scared for smoking spouse,3/18/2020 17:59,"Hi all. This space has helped me so much, thank you for your kindness. Unfortunately I can’t shake my main terror surrounding this and would love some words of encouragement or support to share with my spouse.

I have serious health anxiety— my entire life my parents have had rare and extreme illnesses. The good news is they have survived and medical care works! The bad news is that they are at risk and I witnessed their suffering first hand and can’t get it out of my mind. I live in fear of the “mom’s in the hospital” text because I’ve gotten it way too many times.

I’ve mostly been able to set aside my fear about my parents because I don’t live with them, but my husband’s reaction is troubling me. He smokes weed (mostly in joint form) and has for years— he recently took a break while on a job hunt but is back to it. I have been begging him to quit again, even just temporarily for the time being, but he refuses. It melts my brain with anxiety to watch him keep smoking through this. I’m writing this in the middle of the night after waking up after hearing him cough. For the past year I have heard him have breathing difficulties at night and he doesn’t take me seriously because I have such health anxiety and because he loves weed so much.

What can I do? How can I come to peace with this? I can’t stand to potentially watch him suffer extra just because of this stupid habit.

fjne93,COVID19_support,20 years old with (mild?) case of asthma. Am I in the high risk group?,3/17/2020 0:09,"With the virus being a threat to people with respiratory diseases, including asthma. It has left me worried for my well-being despite my young age and seeming lack of other major health issues.  

I have been diagnosed with asthma since I was a kid but it was never anything severe to my knowledge. I had to regularly use inhalers (first by breathing in some substance through some tube with a funnel attached to it, later using smaller disc shaped things containing dry powder) in cases of wheezing and running short on breath but I don't recall ever having to be hospitalized for it. 

Over the years I felt the need to use them less to the point I rarely use them anymore. Not because I don't think they work but because I experience the symptoms of asthma very rarely. My mother descibes by case as not severe at all, tho she might've just been trying hard to calm me down. The wikipedia article mentions episodes of wheezing, frequent coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath happening weekly or daily, which doesn't describe my sitiation at all imo. The few times I do remember using an inhaler in the past few years was at times I just felt a bit short of breath and assumed it was inhaler time. They'd be over with very quickly so I might've still been fine without them? It's not like people without any respiratory issues don't ever experience them, right?

I am a male living in the Netherlands (where apparently half of the patients in intensive care are under 50) and according to the covid-19 map there's only 1 confirmed case near me. I don't do any major exercise as of late, only a few push-ups or squats when I feel like it, and I usually avoid dirty air such as people smoking or bonfires, so does that have something to do with it?

I'm suddenly a lot more nervous than I was before. I have several questions about what happens if there is a government-imposed quarantine and I don't know who else to ask.

First of all, does anyone know how likely it is that a government-imposed quarantine will happen? At what level would it happen (city, county, state, national, etc.)? And how long can a quarantine like that last?

In the event of a quarantine like that, what exactly happens? Can we not leave our homes at all? I live in apartment with my dog. It's just the two of us. Will I have to stay cooped up here by myself, not even allowed to step outside? What do I do about letting my dog exercise and go potty? She's a 55lb growing puppy, so frequent bathroom breaks and playtimes are important for both of our sanities and I don't know how I can handle having her inside for an extended period of time like that. And for going potty inside, I know they have little indoor fake grass things for dogs, but I don't know how I'm supposed to get one if we're under quarantine. I'm assuming Amazon won't be making deliveries if we're under quarantine? What about groceries and other necessities? How do I get groceries if we go under quarantine? What about my job? I know I won't be fired or something like that, but how am I supposed to handle going without work for however long a quarantine lasts?

I'm just really nervous all of a sudden. The virus felt distant and not threatening, and now it's suddenly in my backyard. I feel like I'm totally in the dark about what's going on. I'm trying to follow the news, but all I'm hearing about it more cases and not what the future holds or how to handle the situation. I know that no one will have definite answers to these questions, but any idea is helpful. I'm a college student and I live several hours away from my family. Most of my friends have gone home to their families so I'm feeling very alone. I feel like I'm doing a good job at not panicking, but I'm still nervous and my thoughts are spiraling a bit.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj9x3e/worried_and_confused_about_potential_quarantine/

fj12hc,COVID19_support,Advice on managing life,3/15/2020 21:08,"This seems like a trivial thing to ask but I have no idea what to do at all so here goes:

* I work in the entertainment industry so there’s a lot of faff about keeping up appearances and networking in person if possible. Especially when people can have so little time, I do always feel pressure to keep them as it can be months before I see a person again. Also, I’m in the UK, so things like mass gatherings aren’t shut down by government order yet as of writing. Theatres, tours and productions within the country are still mostly ongoing and such. I feel a lot of pressure to keep going especially as most people I know in my line of work in the UK are doing so too (in part because we have to for financial reasons).
* I live with several family members who are over sixty and have been seriously ill and I am honestly living in fear that I infect them. They are my only family and I have anxiety anyway which doesn’t help, but I’ve been firmly at home for weeks unless essential. I've only had to go into London once in the past few weeks and to say I was anxious the entire time is an understatement.

So...

* I don’t know what is or isn’t safe for me to do now - I think going to the shops to get food is fine but what about something as simple as a hair appointment, going to a seminar in London where there will be a small crowd (under 50 people) or even just keeping my tattoo appointment? Are all those things safe to do if my hairdresser or tattooist will come into close contact with me? Let alone the transport risks just by taking the underground? I have all these things coming up but I have no problem moving them if necessary, as disappointed as I might be to do so.

I very much appreciate that some of these things sound so trivial but I have no idea what the balance between trying to keep your life normal and keeping home is anymore and I'm getting more afraid the more I think about it. I know I can work myself up more and more, and so any advice from people more clued in and aware about the virus than me would be so appreciated.

Thank you very much, this subreddit has been a total balm.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj12hc/advice_on_managing_life/

I just use a good healthy dose of 70% isopropyl alcohol and a wipe down things.  Does this work?

I just read this article...

*While   rubbing alcohol naturally kills bacteria and  viruses, Dr. Andrew   Alexis, MD, chair of Mount Sinai West's department  of dermatology, says   he does not recommend using it to disinfect your  home. “While  commonly  used to disinfect smaller objects such as  stethoscopes,  rubber  stoppers of medication vials, and thermometers,  alcohol  solutions are  extremely evaporative and therefore not an  effective  means of  decontaminating household surfaces,” he explains.*

    [ ](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a31253707/clean-my-phone/)     

*He says* ***items really need to be submerged in isopropyl alcohol for 10 minutes in order for it to really do its thing***\*,    but since the alcohol concentration is so high, it evaporates just  too   darn fast to really be effective for the sanitization of  surfaces.\*",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fiagmo/does_wiping_things_down_with_rubbing_alcohol/
fi8zp4,COVID19_support,What's the gameplan for surviving this virus? What should I expect/how should I prepare?,3/14/2020 7:24,"Seeing lots of talk about how countries/governments are planning to handle this Coronavirus outbreak and how to *avoid* contracting it but not much on best practices for weathering the storm if/when people DO contract it, so any advice would be appreciated.

A bit about my situation: I'm 35, reasonably healthy, just moved to the USA and only just got basic health insurance via my part-time job (which I started about 2 months ago after finally getting a work permit but is currently unable to offer me hours due to it being in the events industry and lots of events cancelling).

If (or is it more like when) I contract the virus, should I be expected to self-quarantine in my home and just endure the symptoms as if it was a bad flu for however long it takes for my body to fight it? Should I just administer the same self-care as I would for any flu-like illness? And at what point should I seek medical assistance if symptoms worsen? Are there any specific preparations I can make now in case of quarantine?

Also, should I be worried about the potential costs going to a doctor/hospital without fully understanding the US healthcare/insurance system or will COVID-19 tests/treatments be financially covered by the US government? As I mentioned, I just signed up for health insruance through my part-time job but I don't know how it works in the US/whether I have to go to a specific healthcare provider etc.... 

Feels like there's lots of people saying ""wash your hands a lot"" but not many people saying ""here's how to survive it if you get it"" or ""here's how bad it's going to get before it gets better""..... If I knew it was just going to be a case of feeling awful for a week and hardly being able to eat/drink anything without vomiting then I'd at least feel a little more prepared for the worst.....",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fi8zp4/whats_the_gameplan_for_surviving_this_virus_what/

I live in vienna, austria and my friend who studies in the Netherlands came here for the break (her family lives here) and today we decided to meet up at a park tomorrow. And now, i‘m slowly getting scared of the idea lol. I never thought this would‘ve crossed my mind but when thinking about it, she was in two airports only a few days ago and I‘m kind of reluctant on meeting her. 

In case you don’t know, we currently have about 85 cases in vienna and our government is handling the situation pretty well, this week they started to shut down schools, universities and pretty much everything but supermarkets, pharmacies, banks & posts. And it was adviced to us that we keep our social life at a minimum. 

I don‘t know whether if I am overreacting but everything sort of started to get into my head and i cant help but get paranoid over this. 

I‘m really sorry that this post is way too long, I guess I just want to know your opinions on whether I should meet up with her or should I cancel our park date. I mean, we will be outdoors, do you think it will be less risky?  

As mentioned, she came here a few days ago and she was gone for many months and I did miss her and need the social interaction but I also am kind of scared at the same time, ugh i just feel like i‘m slowly starting to loose my mind lmao.",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fi6z6k/idk_whether_i_should_meet_up_with_my_friends/

I just recently turned 18 and while I understand the mortality rate is incredibly low among my demographic, I have heard that my age range has a higher percentage of severe cases than others. This worries me because (1) obviously the first-hand accounts of survivors have indicated that they suffered through 2+ weeks of absolute hell and misery; and (2) the lasting consequences especially affect the lungs, and physical activity (especially ultrarunning) is my biggest passion outside of academics. If I were to contract and live through a severe case of the virus, I would fall into a deep depression if it impacted my active capacity.

I am taking all the precautions I can--I haven't even gone anywhere out in public for a few days--but I can't control what my siblings and parents are doing. My sisters especially worry me because my older sister works at a dollar store, from which she's brought home a couple of bugs in the past, and my younger sister goes to a large public school (which has thankfully been closed down for three weeks effective March 16th), and the 8th graders are arriving back from their Washington, D.C. trip. This means that my sister will be exposed to potential carriers for at least a day. Besides that, neither of my sisters is taking it as seriously as me.

I haven't been able to concentrate on my school work (which is being conducted virtually until mid-April) for the past three days, when I started to really become concerned about it. The Health Department Director of our state (Ohio) has recently announced that community transmission models indicate ~1% of the state population (for a total of 117,000 people out of the 11 million state population) could currently carry the virus, and all the confirmed cases are relatively near my home city.

COVID-19 Security Assessment (Small Business, personal contact with clients)

10 Mar 20

**Virus Facts**

**\*Not comprehensive; the following is collected from public sources, and is subject to frequent change\***

COVID-19 is the disease that is contracted when a person is infected by the coronavirus “SARS-CoV-2”

Experts predict 40% to 70% of the world’s population will be infected by end of 2020

Considered by some experts to be easier to contract than the Flu; the virus is believed to enter the body through the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucus membranes in the body. People are typically infected after touching a contaminated surface then unknowingly introducing the virus into their own body.

Present number of infected persons is 114,952 in 112 countries and is currently trending as increasing with an unknown exponential growth rate. The number of infected persons is widely considered as being under-reported, due to a lack of tests for the virus, poor virus test performance or restrictive testing policies within the regions.

Experts have calculated that approximately 5 % of infected people have required hospital intervention to survive. The likelihood of hospitalization increases with increased age, and when any other health issues are present in the person.

Multiple reports indicate that the virus may be spread without any recognisable symptoms by the carrier. It may be aerosolized which means it is spread into the air by any cough, sneeze or toilet flush containing the virus and air currents within the area may carry the virus to another contamination area but it is unknown exactly how far it may travel. Medical reports indicate a previous COVID-19 infection in China, is believed to have originated from a fellow bus passenger approximately 5 meters away.

Severe Infection by COVID-19 reported to last up to 1 month, some causing death.

Coronaviruses may survive for 4 to 5 days on paper at room temperature, 9 days on other inanimate objects.

Coronaviruses are inactivated within one minute of sodium hypochlorite solution (Commonly sold as commercial bleach, only specific brands use Sodium Hypochlorite within the solution) and hand sanitizer containing 60%- 70% ethanol but the virus remains on the contaminated surface. Common Soap and detergents surround microscopic particles on contact, including coronavirus, so it can be removed from the surface with water and common hygienic cleaning practices.

Voluntary Quarantine of 14 days has been recommended for anyone that has been in contact with an infected person during the window of infection. Reports from China indicate the quarantine period directed by the Chinese government has increased to 28 days, due to numerous accounts of transmission after the 14-day period. Local guidance may increase the recommended quarantine period in the future.

Statistically, everyone should expect to be in quarantine at some point during the course of this virus. There is expected to be at least one other wave of infections, in fall 2020. There is also a very high likelihood of local school, public gathering place, etc. closures in the near future due to containment measures.

Additionally, a UV light sanitizer box can be used to decontaminate cell phones and paperwork if used within the manufacturers’ instructions. Specifically, commercially available, certified UV sterilizers, or UV lights specifically designed for biological decontamination, installed within the manufacturers directions and operated within a container that is sealed from light seepage while in use, because UV sterilizers destroy any living cells, including human tissue.

**COVID-19 Contingencies and Recommendations**

Virus in area

\-Order office sanitizing supplies

\-Heightened sanitizing and microbe consciousness

\-Monitor known community infections

\-Monitor information of possible client infections

\-Ensure staff knowledge of sanitizing procedures and microbe safety

\-Ensure staff knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms

\-Procure office supplies for contingency planning

\-Sanitize parcels/client paperwork before use and ensure frequent hand washing during work

\-Notify clients of new policies, possible changes to business procedures and what to expect if a client is sick/quarantined or if the staff are sick/quarantined

\-Expect reduced productivity from employees, due to decontamination procedures, a greater frequency of psychological distractions and increased anxiety in the workplace

Area in quarantine

\-No travel in the area

\-Work remotely, use of cloud network and home teleconferencing

\-forward office phone to employee

\-Ensure ability for clients to sign documents remotely, (licence online identification verification)

\-Business operations are halted except for business functions that can work remotely or from a home business

\-Expect employees that can work during the quarantine to have extremely reduced productivity

Office Supply Problems

\- Due to the interruption of regular business operations in China, there is a significant and ongoing disruption in the fabrication and export of goods from that country. Because a large percent of goods worldwide depends on Chinese exports; the cost of office supplies is expected to increase and the availability of many goods is expected to be interrupted during the global course of the virus.

\-Stock office supplies in the event of an extended interruption. (Business has been halted for two months in some large cities in China)

Employer Infected

\-Predetermine if office closed or remain open

\-Establish procedures for work flow if employer is unable to work for extended period

\-Quarantine of staff is likely for a minimum of 14 days

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business

Employer household Infected

\-Home quarantine of infected family member is very resource intense and will likely result in household infection to various degrees. Quarantine likely for a minimum of 14 days after the last family member tests negative for the virus.

\-Expect to not work for the duration of the illness’ course through the household.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from employees who are able to work.

\-Detailed decontamination of office is required prior to return of business.

Employee/employee family member sick

\-Global procedure for people in close contact with any person infected with COVID-19, including colleagues, family members and their households, has been to voluntary quarantine for 14 days.

\-Expect employees will not return to work for a minimum of 14 days after a sequence of tests indicating the infected person is no longer infected and no other family members have symptoms of infection.

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from the employees that are able to work.

**Priority items to consider:**

\-UV light sterilizer

\-Office decontamination supplies

\-Set office infection control policy

\-Is Document Drop Box outside the office practical in order to reduce contact with clients

\-Pre-establish Skype/Facetime accounts for staff and client meetings

\-Obtain video conference equipment for staff and familiarize everyone with the functions. Practice operating remotely during regular business operation

\-Determine if a secure office cloud network is appropriate and functional for remote business operations and verify it is working properly

\-Determine the requirements and employ a secure document transport/transfer system, such as a courier, encryption software, or USB security keys to allow for remote inter-business and client mail. Verify that the documents transfer system is functional during regular business operation.

\-Determine the applicability for remote identification verification, in the event that personal signatures are required for business operations during a quarantine. Employ a remote identification verification system that is appropriate to your business operations and will satisfy any local legal requirements.

\- Send and post a newsletter within the office, updating clients and employees of any changes to your business practices.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgn92e/covid19_small_business_security_assessment/

fd2cv6,COVID19_support,Lots of questions about self-quarantine (in Seattle),3/4/2020 6:01,"I posted this in the other COVID-19 subreddit, but perhaps this is a better place. I am anxious, but find that information gathering helps with that, and so does Vivaldi. I also anticipate that when I've finished collecting all my supplies and confident that I've covered everything, I'll feel much better.

I've got risk factors and so plan to self-quarantine in Seattle. Just doing that is hard enough, but my situation is further complicated because I don't live in a single family house, but instead a multifamily building. So I have questions:

1. Is it necessary to maintain an *absolute* separation between one’s living space and the outside world? I’ve ordered a CSA foodbox, and planned to disinfect the entire thing (box and food) before bringing it inside. But maybe even that is too risky.
2. What about garbage, recycling and composting? I certainly am not willing to let it build up inside! But I since live in a multi-unit building and other people will also be using the receptacles. So how to I protect myself?
3. What about using the laundry room, which is in the basement and used by all tenants? Luckily, it's a fairly small building and there are no more than a dozen tenants all together, but still...
4. I have a generous balcony and in the warmer months, grow veggies and herbs in containers hung from the railing. But my balcony is contiguous with other people's balconies. So, is this a risk?
5. I already anticipate a couple of times that I will need to leave my home. Will I be completely undermining my efforts?

The advice for those who are doing self-quarantine is essentially to turn one’s home into a sort of hermetically sealed environment, and to not break that seal until the danger is over. Theoretically I'm game, but have so many questions and can't find any advice about how to do this while living in a multi-family building. I'd very much appreciate any info or links people could provide regarding these questions.

Also, I should add that two of the interacting reasons I've made this decision are 1) because I'm easily distractible, and so could easily touch my mouth or nose without even thinking about it when outside; and, 2) I have fine, wispy hair that I brush off my face constantly all day, so much so that for the most part, I'm not even aware of it. In an environment that I can control, these will not be the problem that they easily could be otherwise.",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fd2cv6/lots_of_questions_about_selfquarantine_in_seattle/
fcp31j,COVID19_support,Family situation has me overdosing on doomerade,3/3/2020 12:18,"A little background: I am in my 20s, living at home with my brother and parents. There are already confirmed cases in my state, including one just \~25 miles away, and it sounds like there is potentially communal transmission involved. Meanwhile, our current living/working arrangements appear to be the perfect storm for this virus to wreak havoc on us:

* My mother is over 55 with a history of chronic health issues (including diabetes and lupus) plus a recovering alcoholic and former smoker
* My father is over 55, and in addition to being overweight (with a family history of heart disease), works at the local hospital, so his (and therefore our secondhand) exposure risk is very high
* My brother and I must commute 3-5 days weekly via public transportation, often during rush hour, and he travels all the way into the city proper (i.e. lots of crowds)
* My parents do not seem to believe that there is cause for concern, citing the past “overblown” epidemics (SARS, Swine Flu, etc.), and seem primarily concerned with trying to convince me that everything will simply work out somehow
* Despite my insistence over the course of the last week, we have not prepared at all, not even stocking up on extra insulin or other prescription medications
* My work (small office, lots of close contact) is very strict about allowing remote work, none of management seems particularly concerned, and my co-workers (many of whom exhibit questionable hygiene practices) are relatively flippant in their attitudes that ""it’s no really a big deal"" because “everyone will get it eventually” and “it has a high survival rate""
* As an added bonus, communally-transmitted cases appear to be popping up on the other side of the country in the very county that my 80+ year old grandparents currently reside in

The only thing keeping me from losing my shit thus far is the fact that this is escalating so quickly and severely it doesn’t quite seem truly “real” to me yet, though I do feel a constant low-level of dread in my gut throughout the day (exacerbated by spending 10 hours surrounded by coughing/sneezing commuters and co-workers). I’m really struggling to imagine a situation where we come out of this unscathed, it's like a personal apocalypse.

fjwq8n,COVID19_support,Different Stages of Coronavirus?,3/17/2020 9:38,"Hi all, is there a trusted website (no misinformation) that lists out the different stages of this virus when infected? Typical symptoms...when they start, what they are and how long they last. Like first few days, headache, sore throat, etc. Then the next few days coughing, fever, etc. And so on for the life of the virus.

I know it’s not the same for everyone but something that maps out the life of this thing in an infected person. Somehow it makes me feel better if I know what to look for and what to expect.

I’ve tried searching on Google but most of the GOV sites just give you a generalized outline of the symptoms that I already know. 

Where I live they don’t want to give you a test unless you have some of the symptoms AND have one of the the criteria listed below: 

“You have been exposed to COVID-19 within the last 14 days before your symptoms began, through:
Travel outside of Canada
Close interactions with someone who has COVID-19
Close interactions with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and recently travelled outside of Canada or to an impacted area within Canada”

Ok, you know if you have travelled outside your country but how do you know if you’ve been exposed to someone who is infected?? Someone can be infected and not show much of any symptoms. Just like our PM’s wife who said she had a headache and sniffles but got tested anyway and turned out she had the virus. 

My wife has had all of the symptoms for a few days now, except she has only a “low grade” fever, thankfully. People are telling her to get tested but the self assessment web sites say otherwise. We have a family doctor but can’t get through, likely swamped, and the GOV Telehealth number is always busy. It’s crazy.

Am I being overly paranoid about this?

I just want to start by telling you that I'm currently living in Italy (northern Italy), and it's safe to say that everyone knows the situation going on here. Also sorry, English is not my primary language, I'm trying my best :)

I'm using this throwaway account because I'm quite ashamed of what I'm going to write.

I'm not actually scared about the virus per-se (perhaps I should, but this is not the point of this post), but of the mid/long term consequences of the choices that we are currently adopting and that all the world is starting to follow.

Every country is basically ""closing"" the borders (starting to think for itself), and every country is basically choosing to paralyze their production to hold on and wait for the better.

While I can surely see the impact this will have on the overload of the ICU units, I am terrified that this shit will lead to:

\- stop the free flow of materials (food, etc)

\- stop the PRODUCTION of these materials (including food, for fear of contagion, etc.)

\- civil war

\- global war

in these exact steps

I am oversimplifying this, but I'm starting to lose my sleep by projecting these scenarios - which are currently based on ZERO real facts (since I have NO understanding of global politics or how a crisis like this works).

I have offered to pick up groceries for some elderly and immuno-compromised neighbors, and it made me sad to think that a lot of people might not have helpers in their life.  If you are elderly or immuno-compromised, you might be nervous about going to the grocery store or picking up your prescriptions at this time.  If you did not already know that it is possible to get groceries and prescriptions delivered to your house, I wanted to share some resources with you.  

Instacart ([https://www.instacart.com/](https://www.instacart.com/)) will charge a small fee to deliver groceries to your home from your local grocery store.

Amazon Pantry ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/pantry/info/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/pantry/info/)) is another good option, especially because panic-buying has emptied a lot of local store shelves.  If you have an Amazon Prime membership, you can get Amazon Pantry deliveries for free on orders over $35.

CVS Pharmacy ([https://www.cvs.com/content/delivery](https://www.cvs.com/content/delivery)) is offering free delivery on prescriptions during the COVID-19 outbreak.  Find your prescription information on the label on your bottle or packaging, and that will help you log in.

I do take this virus really seriously and respect his anxiety about it, but I'm going to go crazy. Every time I want to leave to take care of what I believe is an important or sanity-preserving errand, we get in a huge debate about it.

I'm not talking about going and hanging out at a coffee shop for hours. I'm talking about going grocery shopping for 10-15 mins at a nearly-empty grocery store (10 pm), bringing my own basket to shop in, and getting some fresh things to keep me from feeling cooped up (since we know this is probably only going to get worse, and it could be a long time in isolation). Or going to pick up a couple things from my office (during off hours) that would make doing my job easier at home. Or running to a liquor store to get high proof grain alcohol since isopropyl isn't available anymore. And so on.

He's normally a very logical person (we both are), so it's even harder to navigate conversations when he's making decisions based on fear/emotions (we both acknowledge this). We do talk about it, and after discussing the real risks based on numbers, ways to counteract the risks, etc. we usually agree that it's okay for me to go out briefly. I get that a risk I take is also his risk by default, but I would love a little more trust that I will do my absolute best to minimize risks. I don't think I'm being reckless or careless overall (he agrees), just a notch more so than him. He just fundamentally believes that any risk is unnecessary and can be avoided.

Ultimately, I'm more anxious about not having the freedom and trust to make my own choices than I am about being stuck inside for awhile. Which I realize is selfish. On the flipside, I also know that if I was the more concerned one of us, I'd be reacting the same way he is right now.

Is anyone else going through something similar? Any ideas on how to establish a little more trust (while still acknowledging that going out is still a risk regardless)?

fiii1c,COVID19_support,Practical advice for traveling artists in a pinch?,3/14/2020 21:39,"Hello all,

I am looking for some advice, not medical but rather for a practical advice. My partner and I are both traveling artists, or nomads if you prefer, and we do not have a fixed home. We are right now in The Netherlands (Brabant), originally for a job that has now been cancelled due to the outbreak. As a matter of fact, all our coming jobs have been cancelled until summer and for us that also means most of our accommodation/travel plans are cancelled too. We fully intend to follow the guidelines and safety measures, but it's hard to stay home when we don't have a home and the arrangement for our current accommodation ends in 4 days. We are not without options but we have some doubts on what to do best .

Our first option would be to travel to France to stay with family until the crisis is over.  However, we are afraid that we might carry the virus and that we would bring it to our family where some members are over 60 years old. It is hard to say if we are having symptoms, as we are just emerging out of a close-to -burnout, high stress and low sleep period, but have noticed some slight throat irritation and headaches. Additionally we know that we have been in one of the area's where the virus first emerged in this area for a concert of about 60 people 10 days ago. The area where we are right now as more cases of corona than where we would be going, so we feel conflicted about our need to find a comfortable and safe place to self-quarantine plus being close to family in case they would get sick and need help being taken care of, and the risk we might pose to the parents and other people around.  We also feel the pressure of a potential border lock-down coming up in the next week.

Would it be wise to find a short term rental to quarantine before going back to our family and for how long? Would we do that in the Netherlands or in France, closer to our destination? Wouldn't we risk to be reinfected/carry the virus by traveling after the quarantine anyway? A lot of confusion on what would be the safest thing to do.

I live in the US in a city with no official cases but only because they aren’t doing any testing. Confirmed cases have traveled through my city and I’m sure there must be community spread.

I have asthma and am currently having a bad flare up, the worst I’ve had in a year or so. It started with chest tightness and shortness of breath last week and now with additional wheezing/coughing. I went to my allergist assuming it was allergies who gave me oral steroids so great now I’m immunocompromised too. I’ve been self isolating as best I can—working from home, ordering groceries, really only have left to go to physical therapy for an injury I’m recovering from.

I’m scared shirtless though. I felt a bit feverish and achey the other day although the thermometer was only 99.5 at highest throughout the day. I don’t know if it’s COVID or just allergies but I wouldn’t be able to get a test because I don’t meet the stupid criteria.

My mind just keeps going in circles. When is it bad enough I go to a doctor or the ER? Should I even go to a doctor? What if I have an asthma attack and need to go to the ER but then get infected by doing so? What if it gets worse overnight but I assumed it was just asthma and then it’s too late? What if they don’t have enough ventilators and oxygen?

Honestly I’ve been on oxygen and close to ventilation before for asthma complications and it is terrifying and I’m freaked out about catching this. To make matters worse I live alone so there’s no body to monitor me or make sure I’m ok.

Basically I’m just freaked out and don’t know what to do about my asthma right now or if it’s even COVID19 but my mind just is going into overdrive and making me feel so anxious and stressed.

I don't think we get back until the 22nd or the 23rd and I'm panicking bc first of all i'm worried that it is irresponsible to be travelling via airports and possibly spreading the virus further (i mean who knows if i have the virus or not since it can take time before symptoms develop?). even my tutor who is coming with us was saying that she's kept her son off of school because he's developed a cough. also the idea of being stuck on a plane (i'm terrified enough of planes already dear god), a bus and then in the audience of this festival in such close proximity to so many other people is really stressful. and!!! i'm really scared of getting stuck in ireland unable to get back home? i honestly can't tell if i'm being reasonable or totally irrational. i just don't feel like it's worth the risk but the festival organisers and the university seem to think that everything will be fine? thing is, i've only paid the £100 deposit for the trip. the rest of the money is due on the 16th and i haven't been paying it bc i don't know what's going on and again, i just don't know if it's worth the risks. am i just overreacting? i don't know.

EDIT: The festival has now been cancelled! No word from tutors yet but I'm glad I held off on paying the money! Apparently one of the students was going around class today encouraging people to pay up if they hadn't already. Thank you for the advice everyone! Glad to know I wasn't being totally irrational.",2,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fhh2h3/due_to_go_on_a_uni_trip_to_ireland_in_a_week_and/

I'm from Europe, but I'm living in another European country which I don't have a citizenship in yet, I do have proof of employment and residence.   
I'm traveling to Germany in 2 weeks, and just started wondering what would happen if I get quarantined, would they send me home to the country I'm residing in now, or to where I'm originally from?

fhe3on,COVID19_support,Need help/info regarding my wife and my dad.,3/12/2020 18:15,"So I live in Ohio near Lake Erie in the suburbs. So my wife and I take care of my parents. They aren't homebound or anything that really requires us per say, but my wife (not from America) believes in taking care of your parents as they age.

My wife is 35 and had PTB about 7 years ago. She was treated with a harsh regime of drugs in the Philippines and cured. But the doctors in America looked and told he it trashed her immune system. She works at a local Amazon plant (thankfully shes wearing a mask, washing hands...etc). So I am nervous about if she would be ok if she got COVID-19.

My bigger concern is my dad. He is 66. He's had alot of health issues. Every winter he always gets sick and cough, I don't think they ever pinpointed what it was. I do know his immune system is comrpomised. And on top of that he was diagnosed with Leukemia. Can't recall if it was Chronic or Accelerated. He's on meds now and they are split on the line on if this new med is doing much.

So my obvious questions are should I worry about my wife? And what about my dad? He mostly stays at home, but he does have doctor appointments this week and almost every other week. He also has a pending surgery (on a cancel list).

Seeing there are three cases now a few cities over from us, it's made me nervous. I know for the elderly its only 11% death rate. But I remember them saying immune system issues and what not are of concern.  


\-edit-  
Forgot to mention my wife doesn't have her flu shot. She hates needles and is stubborn. ",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fhe3on/need_helpinfo_regarding_my_wife_and_my_dad/

I'm a New Yorker who isn't in extreme close proximity to NYC, but still close enough where it could affect my home. I've been trying my best to stay calm, but today my anxiety is starting to really peak.

My grandmother just returned home from Florida (where if I'm not mistaken there was a case in Tampa, but if not— absolutely feel free to prove me wrong), and my sister said something to my parents about one of the students at her school coughing a lot and not being able to be sent home because she didn't have anyone to get her. I'm trying my best to stay calm on the outside, but on the inside I feel extremely overwhelmed mentally and emotionally. I'm worried about my family, my friends. Hell, I don't think I'm in the best shape either and I'm terrified of dying (I probably have some undiagnosed form of thanatophobia). And of course that fear sets off my anxiety and that anxiety sets off my fear and it just becomes an horrid cycle of fear and causes me to feel symptoms that for all I know aren't there.

It clouds my judgement and I'm worried it might actually get in the way of knowing god forbid I do get sick. This has happened before and ever since then, I've been terrified of saying anything about it if it is just nothing again. It cost my family money that would have gone to more worthwhile things like rent and bills, and I'm scared of what if something goes wrong. What if I get sick and don't do anything about it?

In this period, my anxiety and depression symptoms are persecuting me because of the coronavirus explosion. In my country, in fact, there has been an explosion of the epidemy of SARS-Cov2 (I think we're the third nation with more cases). I live in a city that is like 2 or 3 hours from the outbreak zone, and they just recently found a case of infection, the first, in my city. I have always suffered from anxiety and, when I was younger, I suffered from death anxiety and thanatophobia-related obsessions. Now, I realized, these thoughts are returning to come forward, also because of the collective panic that the virus is causing in my country. I'm terrorized by the idea of being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 because I feel that I would live those days with a terrible fear (kind of afraid of fear). My thoughts are like ""my parents and relatives would despair"". I also have the fear of being unconsciously infected and so to infect my parents when I will see them.

Moreover, I start to feel some alleged symptoms of Coronavirus. I start to feel kind of discomfort around the throat (as if I swallowed saliva), and I start to think it is a CoV2 breathing symptom and that I need a diagnostic swab, but I'm not coughing and I don't have accumulations of mucus in my nose. So I become beset by doubt (""is it anxiety/OCD or a Coronavirus symptom?"").

I'm also confused because at the beginning I heard lots of people saying Cov is like common flu but I saw data and both death rate and contagious power are bigger than the ones of common flu.

fc3ymi,COVID19_support,Advice pls,3/2/2020 8:59,"I will try to make it a long story short. But this is still pretty long.

I went out of town on Feb. 10th and my babysitter watched my kids at my house over night. That night, she had her daughter come to my house to visit her bc she was leaving the next day. Her daughter was visiting from Italy. 

Fast forward to Feb 21, my younger son woke up with a very high fever and cough. He wouldn't eat, threw up twice. That lasted 2-3 days and he is currently fully recovered but still has the wet cough. 

My older son (toddler) had symptoms show on Feb. 26th. Same symptoms as the little one besides the throwing up. He is pretty much better now too besides the cough. 

On Feb. 27th- I woke up with symptoms. It started with a tickle in my thrpat and weird feelimg in my chest the night before. Now I am coughing a lot, my throat feels like it is being torn apart, congestion, headaches, sore body, chest tight ect... NO FEVER. Yellow, thick mucus I will cough up here and there.

They seen the pedi who prescribed antibiotics and steroids and also an antibiotic for me. He did not even test them for the flu or ask about anything really. Just said it was a viral infection and bronchitis caused by the infection.

Anyways.... I am freaking out because I am afraid my babysitters daughter who came from italy could have exposed us to the virus. 
I haven't heard back from the babysitter today when asked a question, i planned on asking how her daughter was doing. I have been trying to think of ways to ask without seeming xenophobic or something, but decided I was just going to ask already. But now no response lol

Even if her daughter was just fine, idk that I would be relieved bc what if she had it and was one of the ones who didn't show symptoms. Or that she could be lying. Any excuse really, i am sure i would make. 

So, i look at my situation and options. My kids seem to be out of the woods for the most part. I am nervous as shit about myself because I am not feeling any better yet, i smoke and ngl, have been drinking the past few days so im able to sleep. Even more nervous for my fiance bc he has been smoking for like 20 years more than me. But luckily he has not been sick yet. 

I live in FL. Idk how i would even go about requesting to be tested, ect... I have us all quarantined, which i would regardless.

Friends have labelled me ""wacky"" because I care very much about washing your hands regularly, using hand sanitizer in times of epidemics (flu season etc.), but it was always in good fun.

Now, with SARS-CoV-2 going around, I'm scared. I'm a 33yo male, stopped smoking a little while ago, and I'm a Hypertonia stage 2-3 patient — it's a family thing. I take ACE inhibitors as per my GP's advice, but must admit I've been a little lax with adherence lately.

My live-in girlfriend works in a hotel as a receptionist, so in my country (which is in lockdown), she still has to go to work. I'm very worried about her, too, because I love her, because she lives far from home (she's from another country) and her insurance is pretty crappy.

What bothers me most is my current flatmate. He'll move out come end of May, but he's your typical ""it's just a flu, stupid panic everywhere"" person. Never really washes hands, still goes out for parties, has his f\*\*kbuddies over. I asked him to be vigilant due to my condition not to bring anything home, but he still goes to work (currently helping out in construction, moving, wherever he can). His negligence bothers me and I can tell he's starting to think I'm being ""annoying"".

We can't go anywhere else, we don't have the funds to go to a hotel, I can't go to my parents because they, too, need to be isolated.

Live in LA County. Parents live in Austin. They drove to me recently, before it got crazy. Now they’re suggesting I return with them to ATX until it all blows over; their biggest concern is longer term food shortages and potential violence. 

I worry if I go with them, I’ll be stuck for at least 2 months. Maybe more. Could my work start again by then? It stopped last week - tv industry. I’d be stranded if so. Money isn’t a huge issue; moving up in the industry is. 

I’ll also be way more bored. their internet sucks compared to mine (and most people’s). I like online gaming - and it’s a way for me to stay (semi)social. 

Also, they may or may not be moving out of their house in May. They were supposed to move to Europe in April. It’s all up the air on the timing now.

I work at the store, hundreds of people every day, I know at least one person who got back from Germany and I talked with him. I even shook his hand.

I love my partner to pieces, he is my favorite person in the entire world. Our sex life normally is great. Just I feel like I'm slowly watching a tidal wave roll in, and trying to do everything I can to make sure I'm prepared for that, and that feeling isn't very compatible with feeling sexy.

fhyhcu,COVID19_support,[UK] Advice on safety/minimising risks for travelling ~400 miles via car?,3/13/2020 19:56,"I live in Scotland in the UK, and in about a week I'm due to visit one of my partners who lives in England. The journey to get down there is about 400 miles, and so during the journey I would need to stop and rest at motorway service stations. I would be with my partner for a week, and then make the return journey back up.

However, it seems to me that having to use these service stations - which by definition would be hubs for travellers on mid- to long-range journeys and many, *many* different people pass through these each day - would put me in danger of exposure, and my personal hygiene is... not the best.

I'm terrified that I would contract the disease, not just for myself but for my partner too. However, there are *extremely* limited options for being able to see my partner, to the extent that we are often only able to see each other once a year on specific dates. As such, we're both very anxious about being able to spend time with each other.

This is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm torn between wanting to see them and feeling like I need to cancel things and stay in the house. I can't tell if I'm overthinking things or if I'm making this a way bigger thing than it needs to be. I also don't know if this is just going to get worse before it gets better, in which case this might be our only chance for a while.

Does anybody have any advice or ideas for what I can/should do? Should I even be considering cancelling our meetup, or is it not serious enough for that? What things should I do to minimise risks if I do travel down?

fhvl94,COVID19_support,Feeling really freaked out!,3/13/2020 14:56,"When I came home from work yesterday, my step-dad was talking about preparing a will for himself and my mum. He said it was the coronavirus outbreak which made him think of doing this. They are both in their 70s and have underlying health conditions (mum has high blood pressure & cholesterol and my step-dad is a tobacco smoker so is probably at higher risk). This has made me feel really anxious and upset! The thought of someone in my family getting sick or dying has long been an anxiety trigger for me. 

I work in IT and all of my role could potentially be carried out from home using my company laptop, but so far my employer has only advised people to work from home if they have symptoms of illness (any illness), have recently visited an affected area or have been caring for a relative who has the virus. I don't fit into any of these categories but I'm still concerned that due to the long incubation period many people could be carrying the illness and passing it on without realising it. 

There are currently no confirmed cases here in Norfolk in the UK, but I feel like it's almost inevitable it will arrive here soon. All it takes is one person to go on holiday and bring coronavirus back with them!

Although I'm taking precautions, I'm extra afraid about catching coronavirus and passing it on to my parents and other older relatives. 

Next week, my manager will be returning from a holiday in Spain, which isn't currently on my employer's list of affected areas, although they now have a lot more confirmed cases than the UK. So he will probably be in the office next week as normal, and this is making me feel more anxious!

fhtx5s,COVID19_support,crosspost: My life is falling apart around me due to the coronavirus.,3/13/2020 12:17,"(Crossposted from /r/depression because the only thing I was told there was that I didn't have real depression and that plenty of people live joyless lives, which, no shit.)

I have diagnosed depression and am on the autism spectrum. As a result the little social interaction I do have is incredibly important and bordering on life saving to me: conferences, board game nights, public events, the few parties I am invited to. When they are present, I’m not happy exactly, but happier. When they are gone, I am completely alone, and don’t see much of a point to life.

However, of course, much of those events have either been canceled, or are the kind of thing people are saying don’t do for public health reasons, and this seems likely to go on for months, if not longer. (I’m in one of the cities with a lot of cases, and the governor has banned large gatherings already.) I realize this is the right thing to do ethically speaking but it means that now I have nothing and no one. Nor do I have any way of meeting anybody; people are saying ""don't worry, you can hang out with your friends virtually!"" which is not much help if you don't have them already.

The thought of being forced to not leave the house is devastating. The thought of those social events not returning is even more devastating, let alone the long term repercussions to my future career (layoffs have started; conferences are the reasons it exists.) The thought of what happens if I do get sick is devastating both for the normal reasons and because I am never lonelier than when I am sick by myself, with no one to check on me or invested in my life. There does not seem to be an end date to it; reports are saying it may not even peak until May, and it may recur once winter rolls around again. And I honestly don’t think it is catastrophizing. This is an actual catastrophe, and if anything events have played out worse than I anticipated.

Basically, it feels like I have been consigned to a joyless life for an indefinite period of time, with serious moral consequences if I go against it, and I don’t know what to do. (I do not have a plan or anything, but I have more than once had the morbid thought that I can’t commit suicide because a dead body is a public health risk.)

So I went to the WHO page where the statistics must be correct and it is easy to find each country. None of the above countries have their ""first victim"". I wrote it in a comment to the [elpais.es](https://elpais.es) page but of course no one will see it. But it is interesting. Is it some kind of uncosncious ""national interest"" of the Spanish to create a  seemingly bigger crisis than in reality we do have and create new victims in until now spared areas? (BTW I was sent on a student exchange to Spain - but suddenly our governmen has blocked all the travekóling for students to anywhere because of the virus - so I tried to postpone my date at the booking firm , but they said ""no way"". So obviously in Spain they cannot handle a crisis. Normally it is okay to not let he whims of tourists dctate date-changes and I agree they do not do reinbursments.

Every day I go to about 5 houses a day to repair appliances. This involves touching some of the dirtiest things in peoples homes. Their refrigerators, washers, dryers, dishwashers, stoves, etc. I get gunk on my clothes, my skin, my face and in my nails.

I'm only an hour away from San Antonio, which has a lot of people under quarantine and also is a popular city for people to travel in and out of daily for work or leisure. My city is bound to get its first case soon because of this, especially since it's also a popular beach town and it's currently spring break.

I'm scared for my grandparents and I might be going crazy, because nobody here seems to be taking it seriously enough.

My brothers workplace have a few people still working there, who had direct contact with the virus, but don't show any illness so far. I've seen people go to shops and other public places while coughing heavily. Schools only close once there has been a confirmed case. Everyone is still going to work as usual, because they don't want to stand out and be the first. People living in the same house as me go about their day pretty much as usual, touching food without washing their hands properly, touching doorknobs and directly afterwards going through their face, rubbing their eyes.

They get annoyed, when I mention these things and tell them to be more careful. They agree with me, but don't actually change their habits. Yesterday my brother touched and ate some food without washing his hands first and when I pointed it out, it took him a little while to even remember that he touched it at all. He just cares so little about it that it just doesn't cross his mind and in my opinion it's putting us all at risk.

fcjowv,COVID19_support,Immune System Boosting Tea,3/3/2020 5:50,"I want to preface this by saying that you can boost your immune system by consuming various foods that have essential antioxidants and minerals that play a key role in fighting infections. HOWEVER, increasing immunity does not mean finding a CURE for infections. It just gives your body some additional power to fight infections, but the rest is up to your body. So please dont think that by drinking this tea you will be completely safe from catching anything. **You should continue to exercise all caution such as washing hands extensively, not touching your face, and keeping appropriate distance from others, especially those already sick. And obviously if you're not feeling well, trust your instincts and please go see your doctor!**

Reason I'm sharing this is because in the past I've had a bad immune system and would easily get very sick. I get the flu almost every year even when I take the vaccinations. What I have noticed is that while I still may get sick, the length of the time I stay sick and severity of my bouts have reduced significantly when I regularly drink this tea (2-3 times a day). 

I now try and drink it at least once daily and hope that this recipe may be useful for those who want to give their immune system a little boost. If you start to feel a little sniffle or a slight tickle in your throat, you should definitely start drinking this tea.

I usually make enough for the whole day in the morning and just warm as needed throughout the day or next day:

Serving size, 3:

Take 3 and a half tea cup/glass fulls of water and put in your tea pot (whatever size cup/glass you use to drink tea)

Put the teapot on your stove and turn on the heat

Put the following into the water :


2-3 cloves of Garlic


Half an inch of fresh Ginger nugget sliced


4 cloves


1/3 teaspoon of turmeric 


2 cardamom pods opened 


Honey/maple syrup to taste


Let boil on low for 10-15 mins.


I keep the mixture, without straining, in a jug in the fridge and strain out just the water when I want to drink.

Usually I heat it quickly in the microwave or on the stove. It should definitely be consumed warm and not cold from the fridge.

I also add fresh lemon or lime juice at point of drinking, it helps reduce the flavor of the garlic and adds vitamin C to the drink.

You may not have all the ingredients above and not all are required but I would say it is a must to have the ginger, garlic and if possible turmeric at the very least. 

It should also be noted that the garlic can be very strong especially if you dont add lemon juice or any sweeteners. I usually brush my teeth twice and sometimes even have to gargle with mouth wash after drinking this tea. It's worth it for me, but if you have someplace to be, just be cautious of that.

Anyways, I hope this will be useful for some. If you have any other ways you like to boost your immune system or fight infections, please share below!",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fcjowv/immune_system_boosting_tea/

Long term as in until either the infection has been contained or there is an effective vaccine and/or treatment.

I *do* live with a significant other so this would probably involve having to rent a cheap studio somewhere.

But let's put that aside as it's not applicable to everybody.

Anybody else thinking of doing this? I have asthma and although it sounds sensationalist I'm genuinely beginning to worry that it could either be a choice between this or ..... something else.

I've thought through the details.

Obviously a water supply, a large food stock, and a non-shared air source or HVAC system would all be required. These I have.

Thinking about other human needs:

Garbage disposal -- could probably run out the trash in the middle of the night.

Washing clothes .... have tons of detergent. Hygiene ..... buy toilet role and bulk buy toothpaste and body wash. Alcohol/coffee/all other non essential ""food"" intakes: give up.

Shaving .... use an electric and have enough replacement heads for at least two years (you could say I'm already something of a prepper).

Exercise  ...... could do calisthenics.

Communication with outside world .... have the internet obv.

Basic income ..... I already do some work online. I have enough savings to pay a cheap rent for at least a year. My living expenses would also be pretty minimal. 

Deliveries -- either don't order stuff or keep deliveries in their own ""quarantine"" (say, a container kept outside the apartment) until the maximum timeframe coronavirus can survive outside the body has elapsed.

Even typing this out I'm beginning to see how ridiculously impractical this would be. I'm also pretty sure that I would come close to going insane from social isolation.

But for the sake of the argument:

Is this even remotely feasible and does it stand any chance whatsoever of actually working?",46,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/fdzhni/anybody_else_noninfected_thinking_of_going_into/

After hours of searching I've found a reliable source which showcases the genetic sequencing for the strain found at ground zero (the Wuhan street market). If anyone would like the code files to analyse i can send em through to you by email or anything of the sorts. 

I found the strain itself to be extremely interesting, a long polyprotein base sequence repeat going from the '5 to '3 end for almost half of the whole sequence itself. Not too sure what to make of it yet it'll take a lot of deconstruction but I hope to have something by this weekend.

Stay safe everyone!

> **Why do patients with new coronary pneumonia die suddenly the day before?**
> 
> Why did it look good the day before and suddenly passed away one day later? Wang Fusheng (Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expert of the scientific research group of the new coronavirus joint prevention and control working mechanism, director of the Infectious Disease Diagnosis and Research Center of the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, and director of the National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research Center) are accepting reporters from Xinhua This issue was addressed in the interview.
> 
> **Wang Fusheng:**
> 
> There may be so many reasons. The main reason is that there are many patients and the incidence is relatively concentrated. In addition, some patients do not pay special attention to the onset of disease, and only go to see when they are seriously ill.
> 
> There is another reason, because there are so many patients at once, the whole medical resources should be said to be insufficient. In other words, there were so many patients at the time and there was no direct treatment experience, which put a lot of pressure on clinical medical staff.
> 
> In addition, there is another situation. Among the patients who die now, there are some basic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases, as well as older factors. Therefore, it is possible that these factors have caused the slightly higher mortality rate in Hubei.
> 
> According to some media reports in the past few days, the day before the death of some of these people looked good, and after a day they were declared dead.
> 
> **Why does the disease progress so fast?**
> 
> Zhong Ming, the first medical expert in Shanghai to assist Wuhan, deputy director of the Department of Critical Medicine, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Zhou Zheng, the medical team leader of the first batch of Henan medical team, deputy director of respiratory medicine in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College Professor Sheng Jifang, the director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the First Hospital and a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Experts Group for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Crown Pneumonia, mentioned the term inflammatory storm.
> 
> ### ^(1 Some early onsets are not very dangerous, but suddenly they will die at an accelerated rate in the later stages)
> 
> On January 24, Zhong Ming, deputy director of the Department of Critical Care Medicine at Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, entered the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital to carry out work. Jinyintan is the first batch of designated hospitals in Wuhan and one of the main choices for critically ill patients with new coronary pneumonia in Wuhan.
> 
> Two days ago, in an interview with Southern People Weekly, he said that he had faced many difficulties in the early stage of treatment.
> 
> **First of all, new coronary pneumonia is not the same as SARS or avian influenza. In many cases, SARS is very severe when the patient comes up. However, the early onset of new crown patients is not very dangerous, but in the later period, there will be an acceleration, and the patient will soon enter a state of multiple organ failure, which will be a storm of inflammation. Once in this state, it is difficult for our treatment to pull it back. This is completely different from the past. Many patients do not die from the lungs. Because the hospital has ECMO (Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Support), a ventilator, and various treatment strategies, which can replace the patient's lung function. But many patients die of multiple organ failure outside the lungs, which is very different from the past.**
> 
> **Why is there such a sudden acceleration?**
> 
> **Zhong Ming said that the patient's body may have initiated an inflammatory storm, which caused the failure of various organs. What they observed is that many patients have elevated markers of myocardial damage, so the virus is likely to damage the heart muscle itself, similar to myocarditis, and may damage many other organs.**
> 
> Some of the patients they treated were mixed with other diseases. After getting pneumonia, the original diseases worsened. For example, there is a patient with acute myocardial infarction who has placed a stent in his body. After his pneumonia has come, there may be severe myocardial ischemia. The people who transferred to them were all deteriorated in ordinary wards or other hospitals, and they were very, very critical, and they would die at any time.
> 
> Zhong Ming said that there are still many ECMO equipment at Jinyintan Hospital, but not all critically ill patients can save their lives with ECMO. **Many patients die from multiple organ failure outside the lung, which is not an ECMO replacement. If patients are in this state, ECMO cannot save their lives.**
> 
> ###^(2 Excessive damage to immune cells caused by the inflammatory storm is not just the lungs)
> 
> It can also cause damage to the kidneys, liver, and heart muscle.
> 
> The first group of Henan Province medical team leader of Henan Province and the deputy director of the department of respiratory medicine of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were on January 26, that is, at 7 pm on the second day of the new year, arrived in Wuhan by high-speed rail, and then in Wuhan. The Fourth People's Hospital started rescue work.
> 
> In an interview with a Dahe newspaper reporter on February 4, he said that in the morning of January 28, the ward they took over was officially opened to treat patients. It was an empty ward at that time, and as a result, 30 beds were filled in half an hour. The patient came over like a tide. The first patient I saw was an unconscious old lady who was a critically ill patient with diabetes combined with a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (suspected). It was fever, cough, shortness of breath, and blood oxygen saturation was only about 75%. They simply divided patients into two categories. Over 65 years of age, with basic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, renal insufficiency, chronic bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc., are usually heavier. Indeed, heavier patients are basically older. The vast majority of people under 45 are relatively light.
> 
> **However, this disease has a characteristic that some patients may be relatively mild in the first two days, and suddenly worsen on the third day or later. If it is not treated in time, it may die. This may be related to patient infection and the resulting ""inflammatory storm"".**
> 
> ""Inflammation storm"" is that the patient's infection activates the body's immune cells, causing excessive damage to the immune cells. Normal immunity is protection, and excessive immunity is damage, which not only causes damage to the lungs, but also causes damage to the kidneys, liver, and heart muscle.
> 
> For example, after our body is infected, the body's white blood cells and lymphocytes will start secreting a cytokine. The cytokine acts like a correspondent or herald, attracting these spare white blood cells and lymphocytes distributed in other parts of the muscle to the site of the lesion, killing the microbial virus and bacteria. In the middle, it will release an inflammatory mediator. Moderate release is normal. Excessive release will not only kill viruses and bacteria, but also cause damage to normal cells.
> 
> Zhou Zheng said that after the ""inflammatory storm"", the patient's condition tends to turn sharply, and soon he will have unconsciousness, rapid breathing, and then there will be decreased blood oxygen saturation, even coagulation dysfunction, oliguria and anuria, and elevated transaminase . Various organs fail, not just the lungs, which is the reason for the high mortality and mortality of many patients with new coronary pneumonia, especially the elderly.
> 
> There are basic diseases. Under the action of the ""inflammatory storm"", many patients cause multiple organ failure and cause death. This is more likely to occur in critically ill and critically ill patients, and it is very scary. low.
> 
> At present, no statistics have been done. **According to the condition of their ward, from January 28 to February 4, more than half of the inflammatory storms accounted for more than a dozen severe patients.**
> 
> Zhou Zheng said that in a certain period of time, a small amount of hormones can be used to suppress this inflammatory response, but this varies from person to person.
> 
> ###^(3 If a second inflammatory storm comes, patients will soon be defeated)
> 
> As of 24:00 on February 5, a total of 954 confirmed cases had been reported in Zhejiang Province, and a total of 81 patients had been discharged. No deaths were reported.
> 
> The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the designated hospital for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronary pneumonia in Zhejiang Province, and it is also the only provincial designated comprehensive hospital. It is responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of critically infected people in the province. Both were severe and critically ill who were referred from all over the province.
> 
> Professor Sheng Jifang, director of the Department of Infectious Diseases of Zhejiang University First Hospital and a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Expert Group for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronary Pneumonia, said that specific programs for patients with severe and critical illness are mainly antiviral, nutritional support, and control of cytokine storms. One is to control the cytokine storm, and the other is to inhale high flow oxygen so that there is not a large amount of exudation in the lungs.
> 
> Professor Sheng Jifang introduced that during the test, it was found that the indicators of inflammation of patients with new coronary pneumonia are very high. High indicators can cause human cytokine storms, leading to consequences such as multiple organ failure. Therefore, for critically ill patients, we must properly control the inflammatory factor storm. Some patients' disease progresses rapidly, and it may be mainly a secondary inflammatory factor storm, and the patients are quickly defeated. Because the target organ of the inflammatory factor storm is the lung, the lungs ooze in large quantities and form white lungs. At this time, if there is no corresponding respiratory support treatment, the mortality rate will increase.
> 
> In addition to controlling the storm of inflammatory factors, another is oxygen therapy. ""We found this time that with a high volume of oxygen inhalation, patients could inhale for a day or two or two or three with a special device, and the situation would stabilize.""
> 
> Director Sheng Jifang told reporters that the team was closely monitoring the patient's lung CT every day. For patients with new coronary pneumonia, the lung images gradually changed from solid to light, and they gradually became cloud-like, just like the clouds in the sky.
> 
> If it ’s like a dark cloud, then this person is dangerous; if it ’s such a thin tile cloud, it ’s better; if it ’s scattered, it ’s not a big problem. In addition, it depends on the CT of the patient where the affected lung is. Patients with upper and middle lung involvement are better, this patient is better; those with upper, middle, and lower lung involvement, especially those with middle and lower lung involvement, are often heavier. Because our human lungs are large in the lower middle area, oxygen exchange also relies mainly on the lower middle area.
> 
> In response to these experiences, Director Sheng Jifang has developed a set of methods to identify severe patients with new coronary pneumonia. ""The key is to move the pass forward, identify it early, assess it in place, and treat it in place.""
> 
> Director Sheng Jifang specially reminded that the diagnosis must be made early. The earlier you go to the hospital, the better the effect, and the later the delay, the heavier it is. ""In addition, the severity of new coronary pneumonia has a lot to do with the underlying conditions of the patients themselves. For example, those who are older and have basic diseases often have a relatively severe condition.""
> 
> During this time, Professor Sheng Jifang had remote consultations with a dozen or twenty patients from all over the province every day, and each hospital had to go through the treatment plan. ""For the treatment of critically ill patients, it must be homogenized with our Zhejiang University First Hospital.""
> 
> Professor Sheng Jifang said that after the homogenization treatment plan, many patients gradually recovered in the local designated hospitals. However, if you encounter patients with rapid disease progression and basic diseases, you must transfer them to the First Hospital of Zhejiang University for further treatment. ""Most of the patients we are currently treating are severe and critically referred from all over the province, which is our responsibility and mission.""

First, I'm a Mongolian who's living abroad and keeping up with the Mongolian news updates and i'm very happy to say that there are zero confirmed cases of the virus there. Since Mongolia is a neighboring country i was first fearing that the virus will come flooding in but no.

The government has issued a state of alert and closed off their borders for the most of it on the Chinese side. All schools and universities have been closed for a while and it'll stay like this till March 8th, I think. And it is strongly advised that everyone must stay at home. Public transports only work in the morning and late evening when people are commuting to and from work. Public gathering spots, places like bars, restaurants, department stores etc. are closed till further notice. And the capital city's been secured by the military. Anyone who leaves the capital won't be able to enter back in regardless of their situation and excuse in fear of a carrier body.",21,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/f9tpx3/so_far_mongolia_has_zero_cases/

~~Until the 24^th of January, we will be working to towards becoming *'Today'* current with information being provided about nCoV.~~  

Feel comfortable redacting the previous line having achieved the stated objective in the past 24 hours thanks to Subscriber postings.  

We've solicited the assistance of experienced Moderators worked with in the past to broaden the scope of coverage and because many hands lighten the burden of the task, many eyes see a wider vista.  Our task is to provide accurate, reliable information from reputable sources.  This doesn't mean everything you'll find on r/nCoV will be absolutely correct and true, as the nature of this disease will prompt some reporting to *go beyond* what is known.  In our endeavor to provide the best available information, some of that will creep in and when found, will be addressed. If you notice erroneous information, message the Moderators. 

So you know....

* As this health emergency will likely have serious implications far beyond its Wuhan origin, 
 * *Media Link Flair* will include country of origin reference when possible. 

* The *Day Month Year* (ddMMMYY) date stamp located at the end of each post will be continued for now, 
 * This may morph into a day of the year component of Link Flair.  
 * If absent from *linked posts*  examine date and time markings located in the linked item. 

 The intention remains to provide a chronological time line of the events to make assessment of information a more fluid process for our Subscribers, Readers and Visitors. 

We are looking for people involved in the healthcare industry to work with us, both here and on out other health subs. Those with Moderator experience will be given preference. 

Thank you for your time.",21,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/eruqnt/information_arc/

ey4af8,nCoV,Details about the recovered cases,2/3/2020 16:55,"Beside the **infected** cases and **deaths**, the stats also show **recovered** cases which are interesting. I haven't read any information what is considered *recovered*? Is it just that the symptoms fade away or that the person actually doesn't have the virus in them any more? And what's even more interesting is **the proportion of infected vs recovered in Thailand** which seems to be amazingly high compared to any other region/country. What are they doing to have such a high success rate?

So the main question is still: what is considered *recovered*? Because without this information, people may go into *panic mode* but should maybe just be cautious and nothing more. Maybe even getting infected shouldn't make one worry too much if they haven't got a heart disease, diabetes or any other chronic disease...",17,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/ey4af8/details_about_the_recovered_cases/

f4j4oq,nCoV,Details on precautions taken after 1st COVID-19 case in Egypt,2/16/2020 9:13,"Hi. I've noticed the media here is very quiet and the only news we get is about Chinese goods doubling in price, nothing about the 301 repatriated Egyptian citizens who were in Wuhan, China and nothing about the 1st case discovered yesterday. 

As is usually the case here we have to do our own news reporting and validation because the media is heavily monitored and mostly dictated by ""authoritative sources.""

I'm summarizing findings from people who work in the same building where the foreign patient carrying the virus was at the time of the discovery. 

The building in question is Tower 4 at the Stars Center in central Cairo, a retail complex with a mega mall, hotels, and multiple office buildings. The Health Ministry has refused to publicly announce the patient's nationality and further details, but only stated she was moved in a ""sanitized ambulance"" to a quarantine zone in Marsa Matrouh, a few kilometers away from Cairo, where the repatriated citizens I mentioned are also held. 

Companies in towers 3, 4, and 5 sent out internal notices to all employees when one of their departments was notified an employee who had just traveled to Egypt may be carrying the virus. After some panic spread and people began evacuating, asking for paid leave etc., internal notices were sent out to all employees through private communication on WhatsApp that the Health Ministry was informed and proper precautions were taken, adding that Tower 4 had been shut down and since it shares an elevator with a different building some floors were also sealed off. They stressed business would go on as usual. 

Obviously nobody's supposed to share these communications with outsiders but I came in contact with one such employee who showed it to me. 

I'm sharing this because I see extensive and detailed reporting in countries like Singapore including the exact whereabouts of suspected cases before they were diagnosed. The media here has been silent however, with the exception of reporting everything's OK and that the foreign patient was moved to a secure location with proper precautions. 

I'm not a journalist of any sort and I can't validate this information which I got second hand anyway. I only included the facts as I know them in this text.

|Published 2020/02/07 01:43:00 (UTC)|. 

> CCTV Tianjin February 6 (Reporter Jia Liliang) A reporter learned from a press conference on the prevention and control of pneumonia in a new type of coronavirus infection in Tianjin that one patient was diagnosed in Wuqing District, Tianjin, due to the poor management of the hot diagnosis process. In the end, a total of 973 hospitals were sealed, controlled and isolated.
> 
> At 10 am on February 1st, a patient suffered a fever and cough for one week. He took a network-bound bus to Wuqing from Beichen District and arrived at Wuqing District People's Hospital at 10:32 for a fever clinic.
> 
> The report from Wuqing District showed that during the patient's consultation, the visiting doctor repeatedly asked the epidemiological history for no abnormalities. Both chest radiography and blood routine examination showed bacterial pneumonia. After chest CT examination, he was judged as a general fever patient. Hospitalized in respiratory medicine.
> 
> On the evening of February 3, the Wuqing District Center for Disease Control and Prevention performed a New Crown Virus nucleic acid test on the patient. The result showed a weak positive result at 3:20 on the 4th. The District Center for Disease Control sent the specimen to the City Center for Disease Control for review. Also shown as weakly positive. On February 4th, the experts from the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention went to the District People's Hospital to guide the patient's prevention and control measures on the spot. In the afternoon, samples were sent to the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention for nucleic acid testing. The results were negative. On February 5th, the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention took another sample test. After the test result was positive, the patient was transferred to Haihe Hospital for treatment and became the 70th confirmed case.
> 
> In this course of diagnosis and treatment, no problems can be seen on the surface, but there are actually problems during the operation. Wu Lixiang, member of the Standing Committee of Wuqing District Committee and executive deputy head, admits that the case has three warnings and lessons for the management of fever fever clinics. First, the patient consultation of fever fever clinics must be very cautious, especially the need to be admitted to the general inpatient ward for further treatment. The patient must make a careful decision after consultation with the expert group. The case did not go through expert consultation and case discussion. The second is the Tian's case. After being hospitalized, he was actually admitted to the same ward as his brother. A risk of cross-infection. His elder brother has now undergone three nucleic acid tests, and the results are now negative. He is also being treated in isolation as a close contact with Tian. This treatment method also reveals that the hospital is not vigilant and the operation is not standardized during the diagnosis and treatment process. The third is the consultation of fever patients. If further examination is needed, such as CT and B ultrasound, it must be used with ordinary clinics and clinics. The ward is isolated, and it must not be separated from the protection scope of developing hot clinics.
> 
> In the early morning of February 4, the Wuqing District Prevention and Control Headquarters immediately became highly vigilant when they received a weak positive result from the patient's new crown virus nucleic acid test. The Wuqing District Prevention and Control Command immediately initiated emergency treatment measures: First, in accordance with the highest standards (standards of confirmed cases), the patient's ward and the inpatient building were blocked for the first time, and the district people's hospital was sealed and controlled at 7 am. Second, all contacts were quarantined in strict accordance with the requirements of flow regulation. Among them, 23 medical staff transferred to the Swan Lake Quarantine Medical Observation Point for observation and quarantine at 11 pm on February 4. The third is to strengthen the overall management and control of the hospital, to fully protect all wards and buildings, strictly implement personnel management measures to prevent cross-infection.
> 
> After sorting and in-depth investigation of personnel, the People's Hospital of Wuqing District sorted out 973 isolation and control personnel, of which 739 were transferred to centralized isolation points for observation and isolation, and 234 patients were hospitalized and isolated for treatment.
> 
> At present, the preparation of the centralized medical observation points required by Wuqing District is ready. Under the guidance of epidemiologists, relevant quarantine personnel are being organized for safe transfer one after another.
> 
> There are a total of 3 fever clinics in Wuqing District. After the district people's hospital is closed, there are two fever clinics in Wuqing District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital and District Second People's Hospital. A total of 40 beds are available. In addition, Wu Qing has renovated the hot district clinic of the original district party school, with a total of 70 beds, which can be put into use at any time, which should be able to meet the needs of fever patients in the district.",14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/f08d86/a_patient_in_tianjin_has_caused_973_people_to_be/

exfd84,nCoV,Is it of any significance that there have been no fatal cases outside of China?,2/2/2020 8:16,"Can it be said that with awareness, early detection and proper medical care following intake the virus is not very life-threatening? And that the rising death toll in China is a result of an underinformed and relatively poor populace without access to proper medical care (a factor which has only gotten worse as the volume of cases skyrockets)? Or is it simply too early to draw any conclusions?

Tangentially, is there any reason why the entirety of the 'rest of the world' cases can't be treated as an aggregate sample as opposed to 20 (or whatever the current number is) discrete statistically insignificant samples?

esxq31,nCoV,This pandemic is controllable. Who's not ready? Venezuela. former Zika Redditor returns to give his two cents on the recent global nCoV scare.,1/24/2020 3:08,"I want to thank  [IIWIIM8](https://www.reddit.com/user/IIWIIM8) for bringing me back. Last decade, when the Zika virus panic spread worldwide, I helped out giving my two cents on what Zika & Chikungunya pandemics represented to global commerce and public health. What started as chats to my epidemiology students at Universidad Central de Venezuela became quite the adventure: In no time, I was giving interviews on CNN, NatGeo and BBC.  Nowadays, years later, we pick this up again. Well then, let's go.   
The Chinese Coronavirus is a controllable epidemic, at least for Asia. Still, when a spike shows up in the Americas, it's up to the investigators at PAHO to do their job. CDC has already set out warnings and has followed complete due-process protocol.  
Unlike Zika years ago, today's nCoV pandemic has global implications on markets of even greater reach as nCoV spikes show up in China. The Asian nation is known for its human rights abuses & utterly corrupt financial practices, in other parts of the world, namely Davo. This snowy city in Switzerland, the World Economic Forum unravels, right in the middle of a trade war in china and a complicated situation in the Strait of Hormuz. Also worth checking military presence and movements at Djibouti.  Post Reagan era politics weaponized a successful economic model, said application is on full-motion against Chinese, Iranian & Venezuelan tyrants in due response for their ill wishes upon their natural hinterlands. These three countries are teetering on financial ruin.",11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/esxq31/this_pandemic_is_controllable_whos_not_ready/

Beijing News (Reporter Xu Wen) The epidemic of new coronavirus pneumonia continues. On January 24, Zeng Guang, a member of the high-level expert group of the National Health and Medical Commission and the chief scientist of epidemiology of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a real-name certification Weibo that the initial effect of Wuhan ’s closure of the city will be seen within 5-10 days. Opportunity reverses quickly.

Zeng Guang believes that before the end of the Spring Festival, it is possible to see preliminary results, that is, the upward trend of the epidemic situation has been contained to a certain extent. Some western scholars use mathematical models to simulate and predict SARS epidemic trajectories. The epidemic situation will not end until May.

The following is the full text:

Hello everyone, I am Zeng Guang, Chief Scientist of Epidemiology of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and member of the High-level Expert Group of the Health and Medical Committee.

Today is New Year's Eve, and I wish you all a Happy New Year on Weibo!

Special greetings to the vast number of clinicians, epidemiologists, and experts in etiological research who work to fight the new coronavirus.

It is even more important to pay tribute to the heroic Wuhan people. You have worked hard! You now bear great responsibility. The situation in Wuhan has brought great inconvenience to all aspects of your life and work. You are contributing to the country. Wuhan is the land of the Revolution of 1911 and has a glorious revolutionary tradition. Now it has become the front line against the new coronavirus, saluting you and cheering for you.

The new coronavirus is menacing. In recent days, cases in provinces and cities outside Wuhan have been transmitted from Wuhan before they were closed. Now is the time for us to fight the virus. Based on the disease incubation period, I think the most recent week is the key first battle node. The initial effect of the closure of Wuhan will be seen within 5-10 days. If the export of cases across the country and around the world is curbed, it indicates that the high-level expert group's recommendation that 'Wuhan people do not go out and outsiders do not come in' has received a good response. Explain the accuracy of Wuhan City Government ’s decision to close the city, and the results of the joint efforts of Wuhan medical workers and all sectors of society.

For other cities across the country, we are not afraid to find patients exported from Wuhan. The key is to find isolation and treatment in time and isolate close contacts to prevent second-generation cases. Don't panic about the second and third generations that have already appeared. Early control can be completely extinguished. Don't let infectious diseases grow by the geometric amount!

I think we must be realistic and report the epidemic truthfully. Even if there are second- and third-generation virus cases in some cities, we should praise them as long as they report the truth. The first to report the second and third generations of epidemic diseases are successful!

I believe that due to the concerted efforts of everyone, the epidemic situation may have a rapid reversal. Before the Spring Festival is over, we may see preliminary results, that is, the upward trend of the epidemic situation has been contained to a certain extent. After the Spring Festival, they took the opportunity to enter the siege and fight the virus.

I think that some western scholars use mathematical models to simulate the SARS epidemic trajectory and predict that the epidemic will not end until May. It is questionable. It is man-made, our determination, our joint prevention and control mechanism, our prevention and control measures, our mobilization ability, and especially the Chinese people ’s undivided attention in the face of disasters cannot be simulated by mathematical models.

I hope everyone rejoices during the Spring Festival and try to reduce the number of parties as much as possible. Be sure to wear a face mask, wash your hands carefully, do not rub your eyes with your hands and pick your nose and mouth. To do this, no matter in Wuhan or in the field, everyone should be safe.

Thank you, and I wish you all a Happy Chinese New Year.",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/etgy0z/experts_from_the_national_health_and_medical/

I'm currently scared and helpless. My brother, who lives with our parents, has to go to work. I'm here too but I've just finished my thesis, so I don't have to leave the house. My parents are 68 and 78 and they both have conditions (both have high blood pressure, my father has diabetes, my mother has a constant cough and asthma). So I'd say they're pretty much at risk.

My brother is a software engineer and works in a small company. They have quite a few people from other companies dropping by and frequent deliveries, and also a guy who has to go to work by train and bus. There have been infections from the super market/public transport in the area.

Yet, the boss doesn't let my brother work at home for some reason. Sadly we have to go grocery shopping, which puts us at risk, but I believe the risk could be much smaller, if my brother would not have to go to work and be exposed to his work environment.

What would you do in this case to prevent them from getting the virus? Although I trust our medical system, I believe my parents will have a hard time making it and I'm very scared. 

It's not really possible to have my brother live separately from the rest of the family, he does not have an own appartment inside the house.",6,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/fja96b/living_with_elderly_parents_having_to_work_how_to/

ffeopi,nCoV,Why is ARBIDOL [UMIFENOVIR] not licensed but Tamiflu is but Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) is?,3/9/2020 0:15,"There have been studies on the effectiveness of the first as part of combined treatment with other antivirals, the maker (rupharma) lists virus' of the coronaviridae family as part of the targetted drugs, and the MoA suggests it should work on it. Some Chinese researchers have even come forward to say it should help.

So I am curious as to why drugs like Tamiflu are being marketed for it, even for influenza in a lot of European countries but not Arbidol- does anyone know?

Thanks Reddit!

Edit: have written a post on this but yet to cover Tamiflu: [https://nootropic.press/the-virus-that-strives-for-world-rulership/](https://nootropic.press/the-virus-that-strives-for-world-rulership/)

eymhf3,nCoV,"2019-nCoV does not just cause Pneumonia in lungs, it also can attack the Heart.",2/4/2020 15:28," Before    passing on and reading this information, I must warn that this is NOT    an Internet Diagnosis or an official medical statement.  What I am    giving you is information that has been overlooked and very well hidden    from this virus.

This must be known and made aware.

2019-nCoV    does not just invade your system and target lungs, leading to    Pneumonia.  It can also infiltrate into the muscle cells of the heart    and cause Myocarditis / Heart Conditions.  What I will do is cover over   Myocarditis.  Then I  will lay out the pieces of information that line   up to what is  happening to some of the people observed collapsing.

[Myocarditis](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/myocarditis) is [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) of the [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart) muscle (myocardium). Exactly how many people are affected is hard to know because it often has no symptoms.

Many people who get myocarditis are otherwise healthy. Many  things can lead to it.

VIRAL INFECTION is the most common cause of Myocarditis.- [https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/myocarditis#1](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/myocarditis#1)\- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis)

Symptoms can include

Shortness of breath

Chest pain

Decreased ability to exercise

Irregular heartbeat

Complications may include [heart failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure) due to [dilated cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy) or [cardiac arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest).

People infected by 2019-nCoV have claimed to experience:

\- Coughing- Fever- Joint pain- Shortness of breath- Tiredness- Discomforting chest pain- Low blood pressure- Blacking out

Information Connecting Between 2019-nCoV / SARS / Heart Conditions

Heart connection and to the 2019-nCoV

[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200131114755.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200131114755.htm)""These    investigators used the knowledge they gleaned from multiple  SARS-CoV    strains -- isolated from different hosts in different years --  and    angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors from different  animal    species to model predictions for the novel Wuhan coronavirus.  (Both    viruses use ACE2 to gain entry into the cell, but it serves  normally  as   a regulator for heart function.) ""

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270274877\_Coronavirus\_Associated\_Fulminant\_Myocarditis\_Successfully\_Treated\_With\_Intravenous\_Immunoglobulin\_and\_Extracorporeal\_Membrane\_Oxygenation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270274877_Coronavirus_Associated_Fulminant_Myocarditis_Successfully_Treated_With_Intravenous_Immunoglobulin_and_Extracorporeal_Membrane_Oxygenation)

Myocarditis    is a rare complication of many viral syndromes. Most commonly   described  viral etiologies are adenovirus, coxsackievirus, CMV,  HIV,   and  parvovirus B-19. We present a rare case of coronavirus related   fulminant  myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: Nine month old male presented   with two  day history of  cough, rhinorrhea, and fever. Initial vitals   were  significant for  respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute and a   heart  rate of 180 beats  per minute...   It is possible further cases   of  coronavirus associated myocarditis will  be diagnosed with  increased   availability of more comprehensive PCR  testing for common  viral   pathogens.  Reference #1: Adv Exp Med Biol. 1993.  Electrocardiographic   changes  following rabbit coronavirus-induced  myocarditis. Alexander et   al.

Cardiovascular complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)

Severe    acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a virulent viral infection  that    affects a number of organs and systems. This study examined if SARS    may  result in cardiovascular complications.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596695/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596695/)

In    patients with SARS, cardiovascular complications including    hypotension  and tachycardia were common but usually self limiting.    Bradycardia and  cardiomegaly were less common, while cardiac arrhythmia    was rare.  However, only tachycardia persisted even when   corticosteroid  therapy  was withdrawn.

Iskandar     Puteri OCPD Asst Comm Dzulkhairi Mukhtar said that the victim was a     Singaporean. The 78-year-old man, who passed out at the immigration     counter at Kompleks Sultan Abu Bakar, died of a heart attack on  Saturday    (Jan 25).

""The  deceased was   travelling with his 68-year-old wife from Singapore to  Genting Highlands   for a vacation.   ""When  the bus stopped at the  immigration counter,  he  complained to his wife  of having chest pains  and feeling   uncomfortable, before passing out,""  said ACP Dzulkhairi  in a statement   on Sunday (Jan 26).

Acute myocarditis associated with novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074274/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074274/) [Ann Saudi Med](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074274/#). 2016 Jan-Feb; 36(1): 78–80.

The   novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia; however, it has not been   reported  as a cause of acute myocarditis. A 60-year-old man presented with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. On the first day of   admission,  he was found to have an elevated troponin-I level and severe   global  left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography.

&#x200B;

Those who stay home and develop Myocarditis and heart condition... it may likely be fatal.  I am not a doctor though.  They have to get medical treatment and may not even know it.

This may also be some of the cases that are classified as **serious** and **critical** condition.

**If you know someone infected who has these similar symptoms/condition of the heart you might be able to save them if they get to a hospital  and taken in**.",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/eymhf3/2019ncov_does_not_just_cause_pneumonia_in_lungs/

fkrjjm,nCoV,"I live in a tier 2 city in India, where the Corona virus spread has not reached community spread yet, I'd like to help keep it this way longer and help flatten the curve by helping people stay in by providing them with a grocery delivery. I need help/feedback on this!",3/18/2020 23:41,"We've been given leave from college till 31st March in India but back home in the city things are like they usually are, there's people using masks at the airport and such but life's going at the usual speed. I think people are yet to grasp the seriousness of the virus where I live. The government is doing a good job so far with regards to contact tracing and such, but I believe once community spread starts in India our medical system will get overloaded(I have not analysed data on this, but that's how I feel)

What I'd like to know how are groceries delivered in places like Italy, Australia, Korea etc and can that help reduce community spread, surely these places have online shopping. We have a few services like these here too but they are not available in smaller cities(Dunzo, Bigbasket) or people don't seem to use them as much(Amazon Pantry).

I hope to be able to talk to government officials and set up a volunteer group that helps people bring home groceries etc so that they don't need to go outside. Section 144 has been applied which basically means more than 4 people can't assemble in a public place (or they can be detained for rioting), but I don't see that having an effect on the local populace.

I need help with from someone that can share experience from countries that saw transition from stage 2 to 3(community transmission) and someone that has helped with logistics/data analysis/or similar industries that provide home delivery of groceries.

This might seem simple or even ineffective, all the details aren't mentioned for brevity but criticism and feedback would be greatly appreciated.",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/fkrjjm/i_live_in_a_tier_2_city_in_india_where_the_corona/

Hence they ignore official guidelines and some of such individuals actually caused additional spread in my country. 

I've heard an argument that AIDS also kills less people than flu, but one doesn't just have casual unprotected sex with other people. It's still taken seriously. But this argument either doesn't come across too well or I'm not saying it correctly.",5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/fhc5bv/what_are_some_great_arguments_to_those_that_keep/

feafa9,nCoV,"COVID-19 most likely came from bats, but not by genetic recombination (common mechanism for how new viruses emerge) nor exact variant for the outbreak",3/6/2020 16:09,"Genome analysis does not support the hypothesis of the virus emerging naturally by genetic recombination along with nearly half of its genome being completely distinct from any known viral lineage. 

In a paper published in the journal Genetics, Infection, Evolution that examines the genetics and  possible origin of COVID-19. They did a comparison of the 2019 coronavirus with the coronavirus from bats named BaTCOV RaTG13. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820300447?via%3Dihub

They found that 2019-ncov is genetically similar to RaTG13 with 96.6% sequence similarity. They also reported no evidence that the virus is a recombinant, one of the mechanisms for how new viruses emerge. 

What is interesting though is this: 

""Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.""

I'm no geneticist but how is that the 3 areas (middle region, ORF1b, and spikes) do not cluster with the bat SARS coronavirus but the rest do? It is as if the genome regions of COVID-19 was manipulated in those places while it kept all the other parts the same. It turns out that these unique regions that have no resemblance to other viral lineages also play an important role in human cell binding:

""Our study rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event. Notably, the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. This genomic part comprises half of the spike region encoding a multifunctional protein responsible also for virus entry into host cells (Babcock et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005b).""

Two possibilities exist: 1) either the non-homologous regions are part of an unknown virus that has never been sampled or 2) this was no accident/genetically engineered.

fh7bg3,nCoV,Q: Should visiting family come over?,3/12/2020 8:16,"Hey Reddit, what is your opinion? 

Immediate family is flying to visit (not only us) into Winnipeg, Canada from Abbotsford, B.C., Canada. The one family member works with the elderly, but in a private setting (goes to the woman's apartment). The other family member is a seven year old child, whose mother works with the elderly in the Fraser Health Region. 

My household consists of myself (28 f), my partner (31 m), and our 14 month old son. We have daily interaction with my 71 year old mom, who is healthy except for hypertension and my 78 year old father, who does have respiratory issues. 

I feel like a b***h, but I'm nervous to have these visitors over. What would you guys do? If we simply meet in a public place, do you think it would be just as risky if we wear gloves and masks? Would they even be necessary in public?",4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/fh7bg3/q_should_visiting_family_come_over/

I have asthma so am starting to get a bit worried about this virus.

I have a meeting scheduled in another city tomorrow and have no means of getting there except taking a bus.

I live in Israel. Cases here have been fairly low ... but it's been reported that some people didn't keep the quarantine and I have a feeling that it's already circulating in the community.

What are you guys doing about taking buses wherever you are based?

It's a non-essential meeting and I'm thinking about emailing my business contact to tell him I'm pulling out. I'm just worried that I will seem like a crazy person by doing so.

Would love to get this sub's thoughts.",3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/fdi65j/are_you_taking_buses/

exzly9,nCoV,Coronavirus outbreak doesn’t compare to 2009 H1N1 virus (yet),2/3/2020 10:11,"The coronavirus outbreak is still in its infancy, but there appear to be significant differences in its impact and scope compared to H1N1.  

Coronavirus has killed 300 people so far, all of them in China. Over 14,000 people are thought to have contracted the virus, bringing the death rate for the virus so far to less than 3%.  

Experts warn, however, that there are still many unknown factors that could influence the longer term impact of this virus.

On January 29, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad announced that the Southeast Asian nation will be donating the items which are currently in high demand in the city of Wuhan.  

A Malaysian aid organization, Ops Harapan, is planning to ship at least 10,000 masks to Wuhan in the first phase of relief efforts. The organization will be sending shipments each time it collects a batch of 10,000 masks.   

Face masks in China and Hong Kong have sold out fast and supplies have yet to be replenished.   

[According to a local resident in Hong Kong, after queueing for long hours to purchase the limited supply of face masks, all residents were seen wearing masks while walking on the streets. “Luckily most locals seem to be very much alert from the virus. While walking on the streets or back to work, everyone is wearing a mask. I personally never seen that before, even back to SARS \[sic\],” a Hong Kong resident has told The Millennial Source.](https://themilsource.com/malaysia-donates-medical-gloves-china-supplies-run-low-2020/)",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/exz4o6/malaysia_donates_medical_gloves_masks_to_china_as/

evfzwc,nCoV,Translation Tools for Understanding Other Languages,1/29/2020 10:05,"As the coronavirus grows and becomes a broader global issue, expect all of us may find languages getting in the way.  

Not knowing the meaning of the words in front of our eyes is a frustration that can be resolved for articles and text based posts we'll be seeing. 

[*Google Translate Web*](http://itools.com/tool/google-translate-web-page-translator) and [*Google Translate*](https://translate.google.com/)  text based translator are the recommended tools. (links also provided below)

By taking the URL link and pasting it into the ***Google Translate Web*** address bar.  Then selecting one of the 120 languages available, entire web pages can be translated. If looking to post an non-english article, this is also the process to use. Just use the link provided through the translator when posting on r/nCoV.

If wanting to use the text based translator ***Google Translate***, copy and paste the content you want translated into left-hand side of the translator page and select the language you want in the top section on the right-hand side.

|Pro Tip |When presented with a mostly blank page displaying, **'Translating....'**, double-clicking on it seems to speed up the translation process.|
|-|-|

If using Firefox, toggling Reader View on (F9) removes all but the content of the article.  From there a Ctrl-A and a Ctrl-C selects all and copies it to the clipboard.  Moving then to google translate, first click in the left-hand pane of the translator, then Ctrl-V will paste the material to be translated. Select the destination language at the top of the right-hand pane will prompt the translation to occur. Once translated the material can be copied and pasted using the same keyboards commands or the copy translation icon located in the lower right corner of the right-hand pane where the translation appeared.

ev6hjt,nCoV,Conveying Meaning as Author and Publisher Intended,1/28/2020 22:46,"Editorializing titles can fundamentally distort them from authors and publishers originally intended meaning.  Titles are put on articles on order to assist readers understand the premise of the matter being reported. It sets the readers contextual frame of mind.  

The coronavirus outbreak is on the verge of taking on a dynamic dimension.  One that unless thwarted by some as of yet unknown element, may effect every country and every person.  In anticipation of a rise in alarming articles, ones which report news as the authors perceive it to be.  Best to let readers form their opinion and make their own determination on the content.

The following rule for linked posts has been installed:

Titles: *""Titles should be shown as presented by the item linked, not distorted or editorialize.""*

____

*Perspective:* This outbreak does not signal the end of the world. It is not some doomsday virus.  It is but another problem needing to be addressed. Understood.  Resolved.  We've seen similar in the recent and distant past. Our species has survived them all.  As we will this one. Case in point, in 2014 the ebola virus outbreak began.  By 2019 a treatment protocol and vaccine were in hand. 

Our species is resourceful.  From our start the common thread woven through our collective history is: we resolve problems.

feq6h9,nCoV,What risk does COVID-19 pose to inmates in U.S. prisons?,3/7/2020 12:36,"[https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/03/health-care-behind-bars-is-already-abysmal-are-prison-officials-prepared-for-the-coronavirus/](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/03/health-care-behind-bars-is-already-abysmal-are-prison-officials-prepared-for-the-coronavirus/)

It’s been established that the virus spreads quickly among those in confined spaces, as being made airborne by sneezing, coughing and such. I can only speak to the units I’ve been to, all either county jails or TDCJ, and my experience tends to indicate that inmates in both are at severe risk of infection. The medical facilities are a joke: nurses are more often than not apt to treat an inmate as livestock, and any illness- and I mean any- takes at least a week, and antibiotics (if prescribed) are rarely anything other than minocycline or doxycycline.  

The “waiting room” at my unit was a cramped cage of hurricane fencing, a rarely-cleaned open toilet in the corner with a single shared bar of state-issued soap (the green soap, if you’ve been down) on a filthy sink. Anything deemed “serious” enough to warrant more than a round of ibuprofen and low-dose oral antibiotics is diagnosed via a Skype session with an outside physician, and an in-person physician once in a blue moon.

Bear in mind that I stayed at a pretty soft unit housing amputees, older men unable to get around without assistance, transgendered folks and former gang members going through the G.R.A.D. anti-gang program and as such marked as “Smash on Sight” by their former gangs and thus held in protective custody. There were some child molesters and rapists convicted for crimes that would mean certain death at a regular unit, but that’s irrelevant.

There was no air conditioning when I was there a little over two years ago, though all Texas prisons are due to have it installed at some point. The only relief when your cell was >105\*F was the two giant shop fans circulated the same air around the day room. It seems (to me, anyway) a single infection would spread fastest in an environment just like this, and the older/immunocompromised inmates would be doomed. There are HIV-only units, I’m told, but I do not recall the names.

Visitation would certainly be halted if a COVID-19 threat surfaced, but all the food comes from other TDC units (and good god, you do not want to know the conditions under which the crops and livestock are harvested/packaged/handled) and C.O.s are as vulnerable as anyone else to be a vector for infection.

Does anyone know of any research or data on this possibility, or have any insights as to how the virus would affect the dozens of prisons in Texas, not to mention the countless others in other states?",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nCoV/comments/feq6h9/what_risk_does_covid19_pose_to_inmates_in_us/

> **Peking University Guanghua Peng Siqing: Concerned about new vulnerable groups emerging under the impact of the epidemic**
> 
> 
> The outbreak of the new coronavirus has brought a great impact on the normal operation of Chinese society, and the lives of almost everyone have been affected. It should be noted that some people suffer more severe shocks, face great difficulties in life or business, or psychological pressure. It is difficult to get out of the predicament by relying solely on their own strength, and they need the sympathy and support of all sectors of society. They are special difficult groups emerging under the impact of the epidemic. Although this difficult state may only be temporary, if there is no timely help and support, the social consequences caused by the impact of the epidemic may be long-term. With the epidemic continuing, companies returning to work, migrant workers moving into cities, and crowds gathering, related issues are even more pressing. Proceeding from the development concept of taking the people as the center and continuously enhancing the sense of gain, happiness, and security of the people, all sectors of society need to attach great importance and work hard to address the needs of these ""temporary difficult groups"".
> 
> 
> From an academic perspective, the ""temporary difficult groups"" emerging under the impact of the epidemic have obvious ""fragility"" and are a ""quasi-vulnerable group.""
> 
> 
> Social vulnerable groups is a rich concept. Economists, political scientists, jurists, and sociologists have given very different definitions from different perspectives. From the perspective of social policies, the urban and rural poor, the laid-off, the unemployed, the disabled, the migrant workers who lack social security, and the elderly who need to be taken care of are usually regarded as vulnerable groups. Here, we understand the disadvantaged group as a group of people who are more vulnerable in social life, difficult to resolve the pressure caused by social problems like normal people, or who are in a vulnerable and vulnerable position in safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests. In this sense, disadvantaged groups are relative and scene-oriented. Under certain conditions, some people who had lived normally or even ""strong in life"" may suddenly be in a vulnerable position. For example, victims of natural disasters overnight It may become a vulnerable group. In addition, in the face of unreasonable regulations and rich hatred, some entrepreneurs once felt that they were a vulnerable group.
> 
> 
> Unlike the Wenchuan earthquake, the impact of this epidemic originating from Wuhan, Hubei, on social life is manifold. Earthquake disasters unfold in limited time and space. The disaster area is local, and the duration of the disaster is short (even aftershocks will not last long). This pure natural disaster often evokes sympathy and enhances cohesion among groups. . However, after the outbreak of an infectious disease, it can be expanded globally in space, and it is difficult to determine when it will end in time. The infected person is not only the victim, but also the source of the infection. People are sympathetic and afraid of patients or suspected patients. Not only sympathy, but also misunderstanding, suspicion and even hostility, some bad social emotions and simple and rough management methods caused by the epidemic may cause obvious damage to the original social relations, bring about temporary social differentiation, and lead to several types of "" The emergence of “temporary difficult groups” or quasi-vulnerable groups. From the social news in recent days, we can sort out the following groups:
> 
> 
> 1) ""Outbreak patients"" group: groups of people infected with the new coronavirus and their families. They must not only endure physical torture and psychological panic caused by the disease, but also face possible social exclusion and discrimination. The public's panic about the disease may translate into alienation and even hostility towards these patients. Even after recovery, alienation of people around you may continue for some time.
> 
> 
> 2) ""People in epidemic area"": ​​The big epidemic area is Hubei (especially Wuhan), and the small epidemic area is the community or unit where virus infection cases are found. For example, WeChat spreads a resident with infection cases in each district of Beijing. Although there are only one or two cases in the list of communities, the people in these communities are virtually labeled as ""dangerous people."" The vast majority of this group are healthy, but they have been labeled because of geographical reasons. In addition, some of them may be required to be separated from their homes due to strict control measures. Noticeable signs were posted on the doorsteps of people in the affected areas. In extraordinary times, these measures are excusable, but their side effects require attention and follow-up measures.
> 
> 
> 3) ""Limited persons"" group: In order to prevent and control, some localities adopted regional control measures, but in the implementation, they were simplified into closed cities and closed roads, which made some people who were in the field and returned to work after the Spring Festival. Encountered the difficulty of not being able to enter the city without a local hukou, and not being able to enter the rental community because the head of household was not able to enter. They may have decent work and stable income at the place of work. They were originally local builders and taxpayers, but were treated differently because they did not have local hukou or house books, and were treated as marginalized.
> 
> 
> 4) The ""maskless"" group: Overnight, masks became the most sought-after products, and online stores and physical stores were out of stock. Some people were unprepared at the beginning of the epidemic, and it was too late to remember to buy a mask. Now is the peak period of the epidemic. Without masks, it is almost impossible to go out. Not only do you worry about yourself, but also attract other people's eyes. Public transport in many places has refused to take the maskless people.
> 
> 
> 5) Groups of business owners who are at risk of business failure: The epidemic has caused some companies to operate bleakly, and catering, tourism, hotel, entertainment and other service companies have closed down on a large scale. Human resources and social security departments in some places require enterprises to pay normal wages to employees who cannot return to work, further increasing the burden on enterprises. Some SMEs may eventually fail due to a broken capital chain, and their operators are worried.
> 
> 
> 6) Worker groups at risk of unemployment: The failure of SMEs will inevitably lead to unemployment for ordinary workers. After the income source is interrupted, life difficulties will be inevitable, and the poor may increase.

> The epidemic has spread widely, lasted a long time, and affected a large number of people. Therefore, the above-mentioned six ""temporary difficult groups"" are not small in scale. If their difficulties cannot be taken seriously and resolved in time, it will not only affect their own quality of life and happiness, but may also cause a series of social problems, and may even affect social harmony and social stability.
> 
> 
> Based on the above analysis, we call on relevant departments and all sectors of society to attach great importance to the difficulties and pressures brought by the impact of the epidemic on specific groups, implement the core values ​​of socialism such as fairness, harmony, civilization and friendliness, actively guide social public opinion, and promote intergroup communication and mutual understanding. Take practical measures to be kind to the victims, to the people in the disaster-stricken areas, to be kind to the “foreigners”, to be kind to the people in need, and try their best to support the SME operators and workers who are in trouble, and develop effective social policies to dilute the group differentiation and dissolve the possible groups. Conflict. In the process of preventing and controlling the epidemic, various regions have adopted very systematic and meticulous action plans, which have achieved obvious results. If we can learn from this approach and formulate specific action plans to help the above six groups, we will be able to overcome difficulties and resolve contradictions. It is gratifying that some local governments have adopted a series of effective measures to help temporarily difficult groups. For example, the Suzhou Municipal Government has issued ten policy opinions to support small and medium-sized enterprises to tide over difficulties together; the Heshan District Committee of Hebi City has proposed “isolation and no alienation, treat returnees in Wuhan like their loved ones” and took practical actions. At the same time, we also call on all sectors of the community to work together and actively help. For example, the difficulties of the “maskless” group can be rescued through neighborhood rations and unit rations on the one hand, and on the other hand, calls can be made between friends and relatives and colleagues. Share with each other, between neighbors, and WeChat friends to help.
> 
> 
> We believe that as long as governments at all levels really focus on the people, listen to the voices of the masses, care about the sufferings of the masses, and solve problems for the masses, as long as all sectors of society reach broad consensus and mutual tolerance and support, they will certainly be able to overcome the current difficulties and not only achieve prevention and control. The triumph of the epidemic can turn crisis into opportunity, further promote social harmony and social development, and increase the sense of gain and happiness of the people. If this is the case, the above-mentioned six “new vulnerable groups” are only a temporary existence, and they will be transformed into new forces that love the country more, trust the government, treat people better, and participate more actively in social construction.

###Experts talk about rumors of new pneumonia epidemic prevention and control

2020-01-26 20:03:14 Xinhuanet

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 26th. Regarding the rumors of the prevention and control of various new coronavirus-infected pneumonia outbreaks in WeChat groups and circle of friends, experts on the 26th interpreted these as rumors. I hope everyone will not believe or rumor.

**Rumor 1: Academician Zhong Nanshan suggested ""the whole Chinese people quarantine at home for two weeks""**

> 相关 The relevant person in charge of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University said that Academician Zhong Nanshan never put forward the proposal of ""the entire Chinese people are isolated at home for two weeks"". However, Academician Zhong Nanshan emphasized attention to protection, early detection and early isolation, minimizing transmission as much as possible, and reducing the probability of ""super communicators"". Pay attention to protection, but don't panic. Try to avoid visiting relatives and friends as much as possible, avoid going to crowded places, wearing masks, paying attention to ventilation, washing your hands frequently, exercising more, and staying up late.

**Rumor 2: Academician Zhong Nanshan has been infected with a new coronavirus**

> 介绍 The relevant person in charge of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University introduced that in the morning of the 25th, Academician Zhong Nanshan returned to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University to work.

**Rumor three: mouthwash with fresh saline can prevent new coronavirus**

> According to Xuanwang.com, ""Mr. Zhong Nanshan suggested salt water mouthwash to prevent virus."" The team of Academician Zhong Nanshan of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University dismissed the rumor: saline mouthwash is good for cleaning the mouth and throat, and it is helpful for sore throat. However, the area invaded by the new coronavirus is in the respiratory tract, and mouthwashing cannot clean the respiratory tract. Secondly, there are no research results suggesting that saline has a killing effect on the new coronavirus.

**Rumor 4: Taking large doses of anti-flu drugs can prevent new coronavirus infections**

> Professor Anhua Wu of the Chinese Society of Preventive Medicine Hospital Infection Control Branch believes that there is no evidence-based medical evidence that anti-flu drugs such as abidol have a preventive effect on new coronavirus infection. Taking a large dose of abidol has side effects and its adverse The event rate was approximately 6.2%, which was mainly manifested by nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and increased serum transaminase. Special attention should be paid to pregnant women and lactating women, those with severe renal insufficiency must use such drugs with caution.

**Rumor 5: drinking can kill the virus**

> 锡 Xin Yanxin, the leader of the pneumonia expert group for the treatment of new coronavirus infection in Hebei Province, said that the new coronavirus is indeed intolerant to alcohol, and alcohol has a good disinfection effect. However, after a person drinks alcohol, alcohol enters the bloodstream through the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated by liver metabolism. The new type of coronavirus infection is that the virus enters the respiratory tract and causes airway and lung lesions. ""After a person drinks alcohol, the content of alcohol in the airways is far from enough to kill the virus, so there is no possibility of drinking to prevent or treat new coronavirus infections. On the contrary, excessive drinking reduces the body's resistance and easily leads to more serious Infection. ""Yan Xixin said.

f96ndz,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Coronavirus predictions for 2020,2/25/2020 15:29,"Over at r/economics I predicted [last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/f8l4x8/wall_street_has_a_new_slogan_for_why_stocks_keep/fim5n32/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) (Sunday, 2/23) that this week some really bad stuff would start happening because of the coronavirus. Today (Monday 2/24), the very next day, the Dow crashed a thousand points. And that's just the beginning. It's gonna get much, much worse.

While talking to one of the guys over on the other sub, I made a few more predictions. I figured it makes sense to post them here as well, so here we go. My predictions for 2020.

These are perfectly rational predictions of what's about to happen, extrapolated from the current news articles in this sub:

&#x200B;

**-I think it's a pretty safe guess that Trump will inevitably get infected with** [**coronavirus in India**](https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/7kz85x/is-india-at-risk-of-a-coronavirus-outbreak)**, and within the next 30 days,** [**he'll have symptoms**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/fa68ne/coronavirus_is_this_how_we_die_the_daily_show/)**. And in the meantime, while he's symptom free, he'll infect hundreds if not thousands of people at his rallies.**

**-They're gonna** [**shut down**](https://www.stripes.com/tokyo-cancels-plethora-of-public-events-in-attempt-to-stem-coronavirus-spread-1.619616) **his rallies, and the Democratic primary, to avoid more mass infections.**

**-The Olympics in Japan** [**will be cancelled**](https://www.newsweek.com/tokyo-olympic-games-2020-coronavirus-outbreak-cancelled-1488019)**. They're already talking about it, and** [**Carnival in Venice was stopped**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51602007) **because of the outbreak in Italy, just like countless other mass events have been cancelled in the past few days.**

**-Air travel between the US and Europe will be suspended. They're already banning flights from more and more countries in** [**Asia**](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/South-Koreans-refused-entry-to-Israel-over-coronavirus-fears-618419) **and the** [**Middle East**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2020/02/24/bahrain-blocks-flights-dubai-over-coronavirus/#4c189b242b94)**.**

A huge number of factories in China haven't produced anything, or shipped anything to the US for over a month now.**

**-As the market continues to decline, mega-funds that hold billions in passive** [**ETFs**](https://www.investmentnews.com/panic-sales-rekindle-debate-over-etf-liquidity-80384) **will** [**automatically dump**](https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/asc/esrb.asc190617_9_canetfscontributesystemicrisk~983ea11870.en.pdf) **their holdings when certain price triggers are reached.**

It will cost a fortune. People who are lucky enough to survive will be bankrupt.**

**-When the US government tells us to quarantine and stay home to slow the spread of infections, the quarantine will fail, because homeless people and drug addicts will continue to spread the virus. They won't follow any quarantine. And the entire country is full of** [**drug addicts.**](https://khn.org/news/unable-to-arrest-opioid-epidemic-red-states-warm-to-needle-exchanges/) **They will be the modern equivalent of the rats that spread the black plague.**

It's already happening in other countries. The store shelves in Italy are empty. So are the shelves in Wuhan.

**-In a few weeks, people will refuse to accept cash (if you can even find an open store at all) because cash spreads the virus. In China they took massive amounts of cash out of circulation to literally** [**wash it with disinfectant**](https://qz.com/1803255/china-is-disinfecting-banknotes-to-stop-spread-of-coronavirus/)**. And in Wuhan the banks try to only circulate brand new bills, but most people use apps like Wechat to pay anyway.**

**-Entire cities in the US will be put under quarantine, just like in China, South Korea and Italy. The same will happen** [**all over the world**](https://news.yahoo.com/harvard-scientist-predicts-coronavirus-infect-195800282.html)**, until WHO officially announces that it's a** [**pandemic**](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/02/22/anthony-fauci-on-coronavirus-smerconish-vpx.cnn)**. From that point on they will no longer try to contain the outbreak, but manage it somehow, by telling people to avoid others.**

**-A lot of medical personnel will quit their jobs and not show up for work, rather than** [**risk getting infected.**](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-china-medics-dying-harm-outbreak-efforts-2020-2)

**-The police force and the US military will have more and more infected and quarantine thousands of troops. It's already happening in South Korea. The US bases in the epicenter of the South Korean outbreak** [**quarantined themselves**](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/02/205_283789.html) **and are under lockdown. The South Korean army already has a bunch of infected and** [**quarantined 7,700 soldiers**](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200224000109) **as of yesterday. Probably more by today.**

**-At least one old politician (Trump, Bernie, Biden, members of Congress or the Senate) will probably die from coronavirus before the end of the year. Probably more than one since it's so fatal for old people. The head of one of the main hospitals in Wuhan** [**died last week**](https://time.com/5785625/coronavirus-wuhan-hospital-director-dies/)**, along with about half a dozen young chinese doctors (that we know of so far.) About** [**3000 medics**](https://www.businessinsider.com/healthcare-workers-getting-coronavirus-500-infected-2020-2) **in China are infected so far according to reports.**

**-This pandemic will be a cataclysmic change to our way of life. A bigger change catalyst than 9/11. There was a world before coronavirus, and there will be a world after coronavirus. But it won't be the same world. This nightmare is** [**worse than a nuclear war.**](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/198376/20170220/bioterrorism-could-kill-more-than-nuclear-war-bill-gates.htm)

&#x200B;

I know some (most) of these predictions sound totally nuts right now. And don't get me wrong,  I don't claim to be a psychic or have a magic crystal ball. These are all rational guesses based on the information available right now. And the things I listed above are more likely to happen than not happen. I read a lot of international papers. And their coverage of coronavirus is a lot better than US media coverage right now. They report about current events that most Americans are unaware of. These current events that are happening right now have consequences.

And these consequences are easy to predict. That's why I predicted today's 1000 point drop last night.

Feel free to leave your own predictions below.

Knowledge is power. All of us need all the help and advice we can get to get through this. Having at least a vague idea of what to expect in the coming weeks, and how to prepare for it, might be the difference between life or death for someone.

For example, if you're a diabetic, it might be a good idea to stock up on insulin right now. People who have no clue how big and bad this really is, will be hit totally unprepared by the things that are about to unfold.

Found out today that yesterday 3/15 the private lab sent my test kit to a different private lab for processing because they have a huge backlog. So it could be another 3-4 days from yesterday and we all continue to be in isolation until then. 

******************************

3/15 UPDATE:

No results yet. It’s an administrative nightmare. ER doc told me to call the ER and get the number for the lab to get results. When I called, they gave me the State Board of health number. I told them no, my test went to a private lab. They gave me the lab’s number. Lab told me to contact the Board of Health. State BOH told me to call the hospital. Hospital looked up my chart and show results as pending. Told me to follow up with my PCP. 🤷‍♀️

*************************************

3/12 UPDATE: 
Our large urban school district has been completely closed until at least 4/6. 

*****************************
3/12 UPDATE: 
I’m now discharged and at home where I’ll be with my husband and kids for the next 14 days. 
It will take up to 3-4 days to get my test result back. Fortunately I was prepared with supplies. 

****************************

3/12 UPDATE:
My doctor came back and I’m being tested via a private lab. I’m the first person at this hospital to be tested who’s not admitted. She called it a one in a million chance to actually secure a test. I’m also being moved to a super secure isolation room with negative airflow. 

*****************************
Thursday 3/12

So here I am in the ER - at the direction of my PCP. I have all the symptoms and the docs are suiting up before they come in my room. They’re using portable X-ray equipment for my chest X-ray. Here is what I have been told by my ER Doctor:
Bottom like is that there’s a real shortage of COVID-19 tests. They can’t test me unless they get the OK from the state health department. The rule they’re using is that they’re only testing people who are being admitted to the hospital,patients with recent foreign travel, or those who have had known contact with a positive case.

They’re trying to get clearance for a test and have been on the phone with the state health department for almost an hour. It’s likely I won’t be tested. So... if you go to the hospital, you’ll likely not be tested unless you’re seriously ill. This means that most cases go unreported as about 10% require hospitalization. There’s already community spread out there.

My symptoms have been pretty classic. Developed slight mild flu like symptoms on 3/5. Felt crappy through the weekend. Coughed once or twice. NEVER developed a fever. Went to work Monday and Tuesday because my employer said if there’s no fever we are ok to work. Tuesday I started feeling fatigued. Slight fever 100.0 on Tuesday night. Weds felt bad. Got a screening for COVID-19 online via video chat with medical professional. Told I’m low risk. They’re only tracking patients with foreign travel or who have contact with a positive case. 
No fever all day. Thurs I woke up with significant shortness of breath. Like I was just walking around my house and took a phone call and couldn’t talk in full sentences without stopping for a breath. Not normal. Got screened a 2nd time via a video doctor visit. Was told to see someone today either urgent care or my PCP. Called my PCP and was directed to the ER where now I await my fate isolated in my room. Also, I’m getting pretty hungry. :(

hi guys,

a interview about the severe situation in the hospital Sacco, Milan.

there are 500 patients in ICU only in hospital Sacco, with 30/50 new people every day: they are severe, mens for the most of every age.

They are in a coma for 2 weeks, intubated and naked. 

That’s an inferno.

Here's the catch:

1. We are one of the world's biggest workforce exporter in the world, and a huge chunk of these workers came back from China, Italy, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and some other European countries.
2. No corona checking measures at the airport. As long as you pay BDT 500 (Around 6 USD), you will get a corona free certificate.
3. Hospitals will not check you if you ask for a Corona checkup. They will refer you to many different hospitals, but none of them will even look at you.
4. The hotlines, after hearing your symptoms will proudly claim corona has not entered Bangladesh, and if people tried to, it would've fallen in their radar. Refer to (2) for how their radar looks like.

According to common understanding, the 100th birthday of the father of the nation is on 17th March, and we have huge celebratory parties all over the country scheduled on that day. The Prime Minister, the daughter of the above mentioned person, won't cancel the program under any circumstances.

(Look up freedom of press and digital security laws in Bangladesh) But I am old, and am tired of trying to find treatment for days, and might end up dead anyways.

My opinion is that the Coronavirus is not only in Italy but the in the entire Europe: I think also that it isn’t so bad like they said. 

My little cousin (6 years) had almost pneumonia for 2 weeks and now she has recovered well, so many other kids.

My son (8 months) has a low fever since the last week but he’s ok; I’ve experienced the last week 3 days with heavy symptoms but now i’m fine.

Wednesday night, February 19th I went to the Rio Hotel and Casino to see Penn and Teller.  Of course, there were people from around the world there.  On Thursday morning I woke up with burning inflamed sinuses and by Friday I had mild gastric distress and persistent cough with clear sputum.  Saturday I was much worse, short of breath, headache, lots of mucus and coughing, chest congestion and loose stools.  I took ibuprofen starting Friday and combined DayQuil Saturday to control the cough so I could finish an exam and fly home.  I don’t know if I had a fever during this time.  As of Sunday evening after about 12 hours of sleep, when I checked my temperature, it was normal.  I went to the clinic Monday with persistent cough, chest congestion, and fatigue and loose stools.  I was told I likely have an adenovirus.  It’s Wednesday the 26th of February and I am still home with fatigue, loose stool, chest congestion and coughing, no fever.  I just want to document this somewhere in case it is relevant.  I realize it is most likely I do not have the 2019 Coronavirus but perhaps one day we will look back and see it was circulating sooner than we realized with mild symptoms for many?

So last week we returned from a trip to a country which recently had a giant coronavirus outbreak and a lot of cities are now quarantined, our hotel was a few kilometres from some of the cities in lockdown. I returned and the day I did I read the news about the outbreak and I've been feeling flu like symptoms, coughs, temperature, blocked nose etc blah blah blah. So I phoned the non emergency line in my country and they told me I have to go to a special building they recently made for suspected Coronavirus patients.

I went today and it was so secure as I expected, there was a giant thick glass screen and the doctors were talking to me through it and I had to put on a mask and clean my hands and other stuff like that. They let me in and they did these weird tests that hurt so much and it involved sticking little sticks up my nose and down my throat and it hurt a lot. Then they did other things like temperature and heart rate etc. My results come back in a few days. Wish me luck guys.

He also ordered the state authorities to let a cruise with suspected infected people disembark (no other country wanted them). He said not accepting the cruise is “against human rights” and just opened Mexico to every single cruise with infected people (there are six cruise ships right now on Cozumel)

https://www.animalpolitico.com/2020/02/llegan-estudiantes-mexicanos-china-coronavirus/

Flights arriving to Mexico are not checked according to international procedures. Flights from China are welcome and the authorities say the few that were delayed were due to “re carpeting”.

Our incompetent “health authorities” have already given up and will NOT CONTAIN the virus, they will just “mitigate”. Our incompetent president ordered people not to be quarantined because “it goes against human rights”

https://www.unotv.com/noticias/portal/nacional/detalle/secretaria-de-salud-ofrece-conferencia-coronavirus-904904/

A few days ago AMLO said that the coronavirus is an invention by “conservatives” (he still thinks in nineteen century categories) to hurt HIM, then he said we should not listen to anyone saying we should not hug.

Salubridad already gave up announcing that 84 million Mexicans will contract the disease.

The 12 currently publicized cases are the ones that tested positive multiple times. In Mexico they test any obvious case many times hoping it comes negative (remember they have a 30% rate of false positives), and when it does they just send the patient home. In Monterrey there are already 30 confirmed cases (the government has not announced them) and in Merida 4. There is already community spreading and probably 10,000 infected in the whole country today. All the cases (minus the 12 recognized by the government get handled as seasonal influenza cases by the health system, a Mexican senator just blew the lead on this).In 3 weeks to a month México will be worst than Italy. AMLO will soon be known as the “Butcher of the 4T” because he will be directly responsible for the death of more than 4 million people (just counting Mexico), and 20 millón people with permanent scarring of the lungs (median scarring on coronavirus survivors 30% lung capacity).

After SARS outbreak in 2003, I'm sorry, there's no way we are not wearing masks. 
We basically expected there to be an outbreak in Hong Kong, but 4 months past by, there's only 135 confirmed cases. You see where I am getting at here?

Whereas other countries like Italy, US, France, I know many people strongly believe that as long as they take care of their personal hygiene they will be fine.  NOW THERE IS AN OUTBREAK OF THE ViRUS! So it is not fine! Please wear your masks to protect yourself and others. The scariest thing about this virus is you could be infected but with no symptoms at all! Soon, hospitals will be overcrowded, even if the death rate is low, there's probably no treatment available for you.

So please, WASH HANDS, DONT TOUCH YOU FACE AND PUT ON YOUR MASKS

I know masks are so scarce now, maybe consider some washable masks in the market? That's what I have",26,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/fhdyiu/put_on_your_mask/

fc8eoh,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Am I Being Naive?,3/2/2020 15:13,"Been lurking a little while, and it seems that people are falling into two camps - either that Covid-19 is going to be the ‘pathogen X’, the next Spanish Flu; or that we’re victims of a fake news propaganda campaign and it’s nowhere near as bad as it sounds. 

So, my question is, am I being naive? I don’t necessarily think it’s the doomsday pathogen, but I do believe it needs to be taken seriously and is a big deal.

Firstly, I fundamentally do not believe the numbers coming out of China. Their ability to control the press, and what goes out beyond their Great Wall is staggering. I expect the true numbers of infected and deaths to be significantly higher that what China allow to be reported. 

Secondly, if it’s “no big deal”, why is almost every country in the developing world responding so aggressively? The funds and resources to do so are staggering, the impact on their and the global economy is huge. I have I believe there are at least some sensible people running our countries or advising the leaders and they are responding in kind. I  believe that the intelligence our leaders are receiving on the severity, virility, and mortality of this virus must be driving them to react in this way. They won’t be doing it for nothing. 

This isn’t a binary thing. There are always subtleties and grey areas. It’s not the doomsday (yet...) but it’s also not “just the flu”. It’s somewhere in between, and that ‘in between’ is a continuum. Some of us just sit closer to one end than the other. 

So, my question again - am I just being naive?",26,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/fc8eoh/am_i_being_naive/

My mother has always had a severely compromised immune system and is constantly sick but never like this and if she does have the virus then she won’t survive.

For the students (and parents) that have had their classes canceled and moved to online learning: the reason is to create space between you and other humans. To prevent droplet disease contact. Both in the air and on surfaces (including nightclub counters (21+), public restrooms, balls for all sports (see NBA, MLB, etc), and in crowds sharing the same breathing space (air and cruise travel along with concerts, amusement parks and athletic spectating crowds). When we share touchpoints and sit in close proximity for extended periods, our risk of sharing ALL germs increases. 

A Hungarian physician suggested hand washing after noticing that the patients the doctors touched with soiled hands after working with cadavers in the anatomy lab later became ill and died. Hand washing principles started there centuries ago. 

Keep your kids home, doing their work online, socializing through their phones and away from crowds. That is the reason they have canceled school to begin with. If we don’t control this, it will control us.

fkidqs,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Coronavirus Crisis Shows the Full Brutality of the System in Token Gestures for the Homeless,3/18/2020 10:49,"Homeless communities are in an incredibly vulnerable position during the Coronavirus pandemic. They are not only at risk from the spread of the virus itself but also from the responses of the government, both local and national.

Homeless communities are highly social environments. Many encampments around the country are home to hundreds of people living in close quarters. Unlike formal residences, these informal settlements lack appropriate access to sanitation services. Running water, toilets, and even soap are not easily accessible to homeless people. [Public health officials are calling for social distancing and limited gatherings to slow the spread of the virus](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-anthony-fauci-says-he-would-like-dramatic-reduction-personal-interactions-social-1492410), but the reality is that many people are totally unable to do these things. This is all the more true for the homeless.

While the national response to the Coronavirus pandemic has been [slow](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/03/coronavirus-flawed-cdc-testing-kits-slowed-us-results/4930932002/) and [ineffective](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-coronavirus-response-fail-959868/), state and local efforts to combat the virus have also been problem-ridden. Such efforts are still far short of the seriousness of the crisis. Governments of the SF Bay Area have created [some local ordinances](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-san-francisco-emergency-mayor-london-breed/) to address the crisis. The City of Berkeley has placed [some hand washing stations at its largest encampments](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/13/berkeley-sets-up-22-hand-washing-stations-to-help-the-homeless-and-others-from-getting-coronavirus). Berkeley has even [leased land](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/02/26/mayor-wants-to-turn-homeless-camp-near-seabreeze-market-into-official-outdoor-shelter) to one homeless community, known as the “Seabreeze” community in West Berkeley, temporarily shielding them from further displacement and earmarking the community for expanded city services. However, these are mere pittances which do next to nothing to protect the homeless from this virus.

In 2018, Leila Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, visited San Francisco and was horrified by the conditions for the homeless. Noting how homeless people are denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation she said, [“The idea that a government would deny people those services …when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/un-expert-san-francisco-homeless-cruelty-2018-11) Last year, an investigation by the New York Times concluded that the conditions for the homeless in Oakland were [comparable to or worse than the conditions in the slums of Mexico City](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/oakland-california-homeless-camp.html). In normal times, the homeless in the U.S. live in extremely precarious conditions, and face constant evictions and harassment from the government.

During this epidemic, the homeless will be particularly hard hit. Studies have found that with the exception of obesity, strokes, and cancer, [the homeless are far more likely to suffer from every category of chronic health problem.](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/Health.pdf) This includes diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, [which all increase the likelihood of dying from Coronavirus](https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/03/09/coronavirus-covid-asthma-diabetes-cancer/4962424002/). Given this situation, some minor improvements to sanitation like handwashing stations are unlikely to do much to deter the spread of Coronavirus among the homeless, especially given that recent studies have shown that [the virus has a significant ability to spread via airborne transmission](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay).

What’s more, given the history of abuse and oppression heaped on the homeless, it is likely that during this crisis they will be treated as potential vectors for the virus that endanger the rest of the population. Instead of the government working to provide them with housing and medical care, the homeless could be rounded up and treated as a public safety risk. Historically, the U.S. government has left many poor people to die during disasters. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, [thousands of poor, most black residents of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward were left to fend for themselves](https://www.democracynow.org/2005/9/5/survivors_from_new_orleans_speak_out) while the government focused evacuation and relief efforts on wealthy communities. When the government finally did offer assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housed around [30,0000 people in the Superdome, a sports stadium without proper plumbing, food, or supplies](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/refuge-of-last-resort-five-days-inside-the-superdome-for-hurricane-katrina). During Hurricane Maria [thousands of people in Puerto Rico died](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/24/763958799/2-years-after-hurricane-maria-hit-puerto-rico-the-exact-death-toll-remains-unkno) in part due to government negligence.

Residents in one of Oakland's largest encampments are well aware of this disturbing possibility. When asked how they felt about the situation, one resident of this encampment said, “they \[local officials\] have told us nothing, they could come and put us in FEMA camps.” This fear reflects the experiences of many homeless people, who already regularly have to deal with [violent assaults](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/violence-redefined-nyc-homeless-shelters-keeping-stats-article-1.3826801), [overcrowding](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/shelters-are-overcrowded-more-housing-needed-homeless-northwest-territories), and [poor health conditions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homeless-shelter-parents_b_1035952) in the existing shelter system. It’s not unreasonable to assume that during a crisis, they would be treated even worse by a system that already considers them disposable.

In the current crisis we can see the brutal way the state and national authorities treat people in general. A recent case where this came out was the management of a Coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess cruise liner. The cruise ship was off the coast of San Francisco, en-route from Mexico to the U.S., when it reported probable cases of Covid-19 onboard. [The boat was then in limbo for several days](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-diary-of-a-grand-princess-crew-member-as-covid-19-spread-on-the-ship), while president [Trump worried about whether letting the passengers debark from the ship would raise the U.S. number of Coronavirus cases and make him look bad](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1). Eventually he agreed to let the passengers get off in Oakland, but at that point the virus had been spreading on the ship for days and days, certainly infecting more of the passengers and the crew.

A[lmost 3000 people disembarked from the vessel over three days, and the US residents aboard were shuttled to nearby military bases to be quarantined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/16/coronavirus-grand-princess-departs-oakland-lets-off-crew/5058788002/). People in this situation were given little information on how long they will be detained, and many reported [dwindling food in the days leading up to their disembarking the vessel](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-ship-guests-food-grand-princess-claims).

Negligent and authoritarian responses like this will only become more common as the situation intensifies. Furthermore, state and federal agencies are under more pressure to “do more.” Homeless people are some of the most vulnerable in our society. Both authoritarian crackdowns and a lack of action to protect the homeless will impact them even more. Given the response we have seen to Coronavirus so far, it seems likely that the state will mismanage this situation as well, putting many at risk through a mix of negligence and repressive measures.

I think we will run out of available ventalators, and thus treatment capacity for advanced ARDS, before May 5th, possibly before April 5th.

Assumptions: 70 officially reported cases (May 5th) 1000 possible cases (April 5th) Transmission doubling rate of 5 days 0.09% require a ventalator Approximately 13500 total ventalators in US Approximately 9500 extra to spare during busy flu season. Assuming ventalators are needed by each patient for more than 9 weeks and no new ones become available from the recovered.(not true, for simplification)

I realized I had these plausible assumptions, and I saw others discussing our ventalator availability, and just threw this quick equation into a google sheet.

Where did I fuck up? If (when) we go over capacity, the death rate climbs. Part of me feels like this is the next shoe to drop, and authorities have been suppressing panic and afraid of this kind of information being widespread",15,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/fc0k8k/could_we_run_out_of_medical_capacity_in_the_us_in/

With destructive viruses like SARS and Ebola, they scare the shit out of us and we jump up and throw money at it to make it go away. I mean, we dont want people bleeding from their eyes. Bonus is that these diseases are not exceedingly transmittable. 

What if the most disruptive as possible virus to humanity was one that could spread to 3 to 7 people unnoticed, while we are asymptomatic, from 4.5 meters away, and then wipe out hundreds of millions (3%) and additional millions because our health systems can only handle 1/100 to 1/1000 of that at one time? Ambulances that should take 15 minutes are taking over an hour. Life is literally triaged.

Understand exponential growth. Google the drop of water that doubles every minute in a football stadium. After 45 minutes, it is only 10% full. It is 100% full at 48 minutes.

fdjkm6,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Masks do work! But you have to rotate them for safety (refs inside),3/5/2020 4:54,"Masks do work: 

>About 280 medical staff in the hospital's Respiratory, ICU and Infectious Diseases departments wore N95 respirators and washed their hands frequently, while about 215 in the departments of Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery, Trauma and Microsurgery, and Urology wore no masks and disinfected their hands less frequently. Although the respirator group encountered confirmed cases more often than the unmasked group — more than 730% more often — no one in the respirator group became infected. In comparison, 10 people in the unmasked group contracted the novel disease, despite treating fewer infected patients.

https://www.livescience.com/respirators-prevent-coronavirus-infection-study.html

But re-using them could be problematic because virus in the mask could still be active and could be inhaled on re-use. According to this paper, the likely maximum amount of time covid-19 is active on paper is 5 days: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120300463

So if you wear masks once every 6 days, they *should* be safe. 

Here's my detailed suggestions (unfortunately you need at least 6 or 12 masks):

* Wear each mask once every 6 days
* Remove masks by touching only the straps, not the filter
* Place each mask in a new ventilated bag when you take it off (paper bag or ziplock that's not closed) to allow them to dry off
* Label each bag with the date (or day of the week) you wore it, and don't touch it for 5 days. You can re-use it on the 6th day.
* If you commute to work, it would be best to use 2 masks per day - one for going and one for returning

Here's a bonus study modeling masks and influenza, showing that if 80% of the population wore masks there would be no epidemic at all!

fjwnpg,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Why Corona might never leave us and true reason why Corona is dangerous [WARNING: Possible Panic],3/17/2020 9:34,"Dear community,

I do seek sincere and helpful support (advocatus diaboli in best case here) for following ideas which came to me and PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG in a scientific way:::::::

We do all know that the Influenza flu virus exists for several decades, as example, each year in Germany we have approx. 80K - 120k infected people with influenza on an average. Death toll for this season was 200 in Germany. 

The basic reproduction number for the flu is approx 2.

In Germany approx. 10 % of all people got an Influenza vaccine.

----

We do know that Corona has a basic reproduction number of WORST CASE 2,3 up to 4.

We do know that Corona is 10-20 times deadlier  in comparison to flu (0,2 -2% based on demographic and specific prequesites)


We have no vaccine yet.

Now everybody including non-informed people believe that Corona will be forgotten just like swine flu or Ebola but the hard facts show us that its more persistent than Influenza, deadlier than Influenza and it has a higher transmission rate than influenza AND there is no vacccine for Corona.

What I am trying to say: Why are we ""EVEN"" unable to cure the flu for 99%? We seem to fail to cure the classical Influenza but tend to believe that Corona can be eliminated easily?

The infected rate and death toll rate for Influenza considers that 10% got a vaccine. Imagine the flu without ANY vaccine + 10-20 times deadlier?

A full cleansing of Corona from a state does only work, if sufficient amount of people get force vaccinated no matter what. Otherwise Corona cant be stopped fully.

Of course a draconic measurement like FULL quarantine lockdown acts like a catalyst but this would mean to shift entire nations against any basic law of economics (Capitalism suffering)

Basically you can start to consider to call Corona flu 2.0 which will also be everlasting like the flu does for approx. 200 years.


If we receive 80-120k  infected people with flu in 1 year with RO = 2, what the fuck will happen with Corona with R0=2,3-4 in a year in 1 country without 0 vaccines)

We cant have a full lockdown for months, this would be too inconvenient for ""pseudo""-demogratic countries, they could either not proceed with correct but draconic measurements which china used since this would be way too harsh for the convenient countries. Nobody would be used to it!

PS: I didnt even talk about mutation and the fact that we would need a vaccine each year like we need for the flu, this topic regarding mutation would make my hypothesis more crazy, so lets just stick to the topic above...

PPS: Just like the flu which comes in waves, expect people to believe the Coronavirus has been beaten. 

In summer the infection rate might go down just as the flu.

Once we arrive on the next winter, Corona 2.0 will have a worse comeback... :)

My job I thankfully can work from home on, however my dealership is worried if things go as bad as predicted they won’t be able to stay open meaning I’ll lose my job. They just cancelled schools and because I have a 5 year old with no childcare now and no one to watch him I’ve asked to work remotely more often which I haven’t gotten a great response. My boss I report to his speaking to his boss to find out what they want to do regarding my job. So I don’t even know if I have a job! 

I am worried because I only have enough in savings to get by for maybe a month... I don’t know what I am going to do if I lose my job. I know they have already paused bills for power and water in my area so if we can’t pay it won’t get disconnected. However what about rent??

As the current crisis unfolds, governments are enforcing quarantine and isolation, and public gatherings are being discouraged. Health officials took the same approach 100 years ago, when influenza was spreading around the world. The results were mixed. But records from the 1918 pandemic suggest one technique for dealing with influenza — little-known today — was effective. Some hard-won experience from the greatest pandemic in recorded history could help us in the weeks and months ahead.

Influenza patients getting sunlight at the Camp Brooks emergency open-air hospital in Boston. Medical staff were not supposed to remove their masks. (National Archives)
Put simply, medics found that severely ill flu patients nursed outdoors recovered better than those treated indoors. A combination of fresh air and sunlight seems to have prevented deaths among patients; and infections among medical staff.[1] There is scientific support for this. Research shows that outdoor air is a natural disinfectant. Fresh air can kill the flu virus and other harmful germs.

fhak2i,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Posting this here because this subreddit (thankfully) allows text posts. The death rate IS NOT 2-3%. It's HIGHER.,3/12/2020 12:10,"The 2-3% is based on dividing current deaths by current infected (as of writing: 4,600 (dead) ÷ 126,000 (current infected March 11, 12:00 PM EST x 100 =  3.6 (%)) which in itself is incorrect. You do not die as soon as you get the virus. It can take (on average) 14 days to either recover or die. (https://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/respiratory/corona-virus.htm as well as https://www.hygiene-in-practice.com/pathogen/coronavirus/ among others) 
So dividing current deaths by current infected is a lie and is most likely spread to lessen panic (that is my assumption take it as such) A more accurate way to calculate the death rate would be to divide the death count by the recovered count. So 4,600 ÷ 68,000 x 100 (multiplying by 100 gives an easy decimal place for people who don't understand the math) and it equals 6.7 (%). 

The only problem with his method is that a large majority of deaths are underreported in certain areas of china and other countries (look at Guangdong in china, 1,356 infected but only 8 deaths and 1,288 recovered??) It's obvious they are underreporting, same with Iran which has somehow had EXACTLY 9,000 cases EVEN with no fluctuations whatsoever in 8 hours. So factoring in the underreported death toll it's reasonable to assume that the actual death toll is closer to 8%.

map.bitboy.live is where I got the numbers for infected dead recovered as well as specifics for china and Iran. The interactive map is run by the John Hopkins University and has been fact checked so many times by myself, others I know, YouTubers such as 'The CEO Of Facts' and if you don't believe me, check the numbers yourself or contact the university.

fdmv7x,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,Reusable Fabric Masks Should Become the New Fashion to Help us Fighting Against COVID-19,3/5/2020 8:37,"After the Wuhan blockade was announced on January 23th, the Chinese government has recommended or even mandated that everybody should wear face masks while being at any public space. Needless to say, that has generated a big shortage of face masks, both domestically and internationally, with overseas Chinese buying loads of masks to be donated back to China. 

Now with COVID-19 rapidly becoming an international pandemic, the global shortage of medical masks has further heightened. Many countries have banned export of medical masks, and the price of raw materials needs to produce these masks has skyrocketed. With this backdrop, instead of recommending everyone to wear a face mask like the Chinese, many health officials in other countries have emphasized that medical masks should be reserved for medical personnel and patients with respiratory disease symptoms; and for the general public, the advice is frequent hand cleaning, keeping distance from each other, and avoiding touching mouth and nose area while being out. While these recommendations are sensible given the mask shortage, there are two potential problems. Firstly, there is already quite a lot of evidence that COVID-19 patients during the incubation period and people with asymptomatic infection can pass the virus to others: if a patient only starts to wear masks after showing symptoms, it would be too late as most likely he would have already passed the virus to multiple people given the high R0(basic reproduction rate) of the disease, not to mention people with asymptomatic infection would be dangerous to others without anyone realizing it. Secondly, it is rather difficult to stop touching one's mouth and nose because it is something people unconsciously do quite often. Some health officials were even caught on camera that right after they advised the public against it, they did it themselves within seconds, of course, without realizing it. Here is where a mask can offer real protection, even if only a mask made of paper, as it can stop such kind of potentially dangerous touch. Yes, those super duper medical masks which offer 99% or even higher protection against virus penetration should be reserved for medical personnel and patients with symptoms, but the general public should wear face masks as much as possible in public space as well. Essentially, face mask with almost any fabric can help to reduce the spread of the disease to some extent. We should not forget that before the days of throw-away medical masks, masks made of multi-layer cotton cloth did offer quite some protection for doctors and nurses against diseases like tuberculosis. Another beauty of such kind of fabric masks is that they are washable and reusable, thus much easier to be supplied compared to the one-time use medical masks. With some public policy and price incentives, a significant part of global textile industry can be quickly re-tooled to produce reusable fabric masks for the general public.

Of course, no matter what kind of mask one wears, cautions need to be taken while removing the masks, to avoid contamination and possible contact infection, I will leave that part of details to medical professionals. In summary, reusable fabric masks should and can become the new fashion to help us fighting against COVID-19.",8,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/fdmv7x/reusable_fabric_masks_should_become_the_new/

fhc1re,CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV,We need to skip efficacy testing for Remdesivir. This is absolutely CRITICAL,3/12/2020 14:30,"We already know the drug is relatively safe due to prior trials.  Right now it is being used for extreme cases.  That's not good enough.  Our containment measures have failed in Europe and possibly the United States.  

This is an extraordinary time and it requires extraordinary measures.  Getting this drug into the field to treat COVID19 immediately is not a knee jerk reaction.  It's what is necessary to get the outbreak under control in Italy and prevent another situation like Italy elsewhere.  

I don't know how to get a mass campaign started, but please if we can pressure the government to push this through perhaps by executive order it would save so many lives.

We also need to keep pressure on developing a vaccine because this virus could still mutate and the one shot we have now might not work if a strain develops to be resistant to the antiviral treatment.",8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/fhc1re/we_need_to_skip_efficacy_testing_for_remdesivir/

I have been planning a 6 month road trip for quite some time (quit my job a few months ago to prepare). My plan is to leave April 15th and return mid-October. Selfishly, I'd still really like to go so all this time I've spent unemployed isn't completely wasted. With that said, I completely understand the dangers of this disease. While I don't think I have a lot to worry about (30yo), I'm curious if state and national parks will likely be shut down if this spread continues as anticipated? I plan on carcamping for most of the trip so I can somewhat limit contact with people. My current plan is to hold off on booking campsites at national parks and potentially postpone my trip depending on how the next 2 weeks goes. Any and all opinions would be greatly appreciated. Most people around me keep saying ""it's just like the flu calm down"". While I don't agree, it's disheartening that so many people think it's foolish for me to delay/cancel my trip for now.",7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV/comments/femgt6/coronavirus_and_us_roadtrip/

>Here in Seattle, we are Ground Zero of an emerging epidemic. As of this morning, there are 18 cases of Covid-19 in our hospitals. Six people have died. 48 schools are closed. Employers are scrambling to create plans to keep people working from home, and keep them off airplanes. Our best scientists tell us that there are probably 2000 undiagnosed cases wandering our streets, a number they expect will double every six days.  
>  
>Shit here has gotten very, very real.   
>  
>But here's what's most disturbing: I don't think any of y'all even know this is happening. I'm mentioning all of this in my FB wanderings, and am being met with a surprising level of skepticism. I'm finally coming to realize nobody outside of the PNW is being told any of this. The national news apparently isn't covering it at all. Google searches aren't returning the info (though the Seattle Times is covering all of this very aggressively). It's like we're here, struggling at the leading edge of something that's about to roll across the rest of you in the weeks ahead -- and yet it's happening in total silence, outside the view of the rest of the nation.

>  
>What I'm asking for: If you want to know what's really happening with this epidemic, keep your eyes on Seattle. (Google will not make this easy, so look at the Seattle Times, Crosscut, and the site below.) Because what we're going through now is what the rest of you are going to be facing in two weeks, a month, maybe by Easter, maybe as late as May. If you think you have time to prepare -- you don't. If you think that this is still a problem in Italy or Korea -- it's not. It's here, it's real, people are dying, our lives are being upended (I will not be leaving my home for the foreseeable future), and apparently nobody in our fractured media is conveying this to anyone outside our borders.

f9gs9v,CoronavirusFOS,I’m a possible US case and nobody knows what to do,2/26/2020 4:40,"I’m a US possible report but nobody knows what to do and we haven’t been able to find a way to get tested. 

Three of my coworkers returned from China a couple weeks ago. Now my girlfriend and I (34f and 33f) and son (4m) all have a nasty respiratory bug/cough and fever. 

I’m not panicking, but did want to get tested since we fit the parameters and all have asthma and I’m also around newborns and pregnant people weekly. But I’m getting nowhere. Our pediatrician said to call the county health department. That lady had never heard of COVID19 and sent me to a local government clinic. They also had no protocols and didn’t know where to send me. 

I called the CDC who just said to go to our pediatrician with a clearly practiced standard line. I explained the ped didn’t know the protocol and had sent us away and they just said to tell the ped to call their hotline. 

Called the pediatrician back and they said they’d talk with their manager and call me back. That was two hours ago. 

The US is NOT prepared. I know it’s unlikely that we actually have it, but it will be cases just like mine that do cause a spread.

Edit: Update: I am within driving distance to John’s Hopkins children’s hospital. I called them and they were great and actually took a full history. They then went to their higher ups to discuss and called me back. They said that because I can’t confirm that any coworkers had the virus, nor were they direct healthcare workers with the virus, that we are considered zero risk to very low risk. We showered and sanitized and masked up and are at urgent care now to test for the flu per Johns Hopkins advice. The first form we had to fill out here was all about coronavirus, asking if we wanted to get tested for it. Then when they read my history on the form, they said they don’t actually have any tests for it, nor do the ERs. So we will see if this is the flu or not and just keep isolating until we are free and clear.

**There are now two recognized strains of the disease.** The L strain is more infectious and severe than the ancestral S strain:

https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463

**The disease has an R0, the reproduction value, of around 6.6, which means 1 person infects that many other people, on average.** There are also super-spreader incidents where one person can infect dozens of others. The R0 has been variously calculated as being somewhere between 3 and 7, and one Belgian scientist says between 4.7 to 7. In some locales, the R0 may vary depending on human behavior:

**SARS-CoV is known to have spread by the oral-fecal route and through airborne sewage particulate matter, and SARS-CoV-2 is likely no different in that regard.** SARS causes enteric symptoms and contaminates sewers and makes them hazardous:

**The virus attacks ACE2 receptors in cells.** ACE2 stands for Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2, and it's part of the angiotensin-renin system that regulates vasoconstriction and vasodilation. This system is essential for your body to maintain the correct blood pressure. ACE2 receptors are found in many vital organs and reproductive tissues in the human body. Lungs, heart, kidneys, brain. SARS-CoV-2 infection may also have negative effects on male fertility. ACE2 receptors are found in the seminiferous ducts of the testis. When the virus binds to ACE2 receptors, it leaves excess circulating Angiotensin II, which goes on to cause inflammation in the lungs:

**SARS-CoV-2 can also possibly cause massive co-infections of prevotella, a normally harmless gut bacteria, potentially even displaying bacteriophage-like synergistic behavior with prevotella.** The researchers seemed to have low confidence in this result, but it may be something worth following up on to see if the virus actually is capable of bacteriophage-like behavior in vitro:

**Angiotensin blockers (ARBs), like Losartan and Telmisartan, can potentially keep SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses away from ACE2 receptors, but they may have unwanted side effects.** In some cases, ARBs should perhaps be avoided entirely, as they may increase expression of ACE2 over time:

**Quick Summary:**

-Extremely contagious.

-Long incubation period with asymptomatic transmission.

-Very high likelihood of airborne aerosol transmission as well as oral-fecal transmission.

-Causes severe bilateral viral pneumonia with ground-glass opacities in the lungs visible on CT.

-Can potentially cause myocarditis and subsequent myoglobinemia that shuts down the kidneys due to myoglobin entering the blood from the damaged heart.

-Can potentially damage blood vessels with vasculitis especially inside certain vital organs.

-Can potentially damage blood vessels and/or neurons in the brain (which may be the cause for the mysterious sudden drop fatalities with people suffering apparent brain death and seizures, as seen in leaked social media footage). Could cause persistent brain damage, brain stem injury, diaphragm paralysis, seizures, and possibly even a persistent vegetative state due to its neuroinvasive potential.

-As if that wasn’t bad enough, it could even infect normally harmless gut bacteria and form a symbiotic relationship with it, possibly becoming a persistent environmental contaminant when COVID-19 victims defecate symbiotic colonies of prevotella and SARS-CoV-2 (bacteriophage-like behavior?).

**Necessary PPE/Protective Measures:**

-Full-face P100 or Full-face 40mm NATO CBRN respirator or CBRN-rated hood unit/PAPR necessary

-Skin-tight goggles and a half-face P100 may be used if nothing else is available (full-face respirator or hood preferable)

-Disposable overalls and boot covers (Tyvek or Tychem)

-Nitrile Gloves (8-mil or double-gloved 4-mil)

-Chemtape (to seal wrists and other gaps)

-Decontamination of all gear with peroxide coupled with proper doffing technique, followed by thorough hand-washing and showering

**Inadequate PPE/Protective Measures**

-N95 half-face respirators or surgical masks (the virus can enter the eyes and is small enough to pass through N95 filter media, and loose-fitting surgical masks provide no protection at all; they only help trap your own droplets or aerosols if you’re already sick)

-Face shield (the virus droplets or aerosols can go around the shield and enter the eyes)

-Nitrile gloves alone (most infections are from droplets or aerosols, not touching fomites)

-Hand-washing alone, with no PPE (see above)

This thing is so much scarier than the flu, it's unbelievable.

COVID-19 is a deceptive and sinister disease that outwardly presents as severe pneumonia while stealthily causing damage to many of its victims’ vital organs. Then, they defecate, and their sewage contaminates sewers, groundwater, and bodies of water, infecting other people. That does not mean that it is limited to infecting by the oral-fecal route. If one so much as breathes the exhaled air of a COVID-19 victim, they can be sickened by that person’s exhaled aerosols.

There is no natural immunity or herd immunity, and anyone can become sickened. TH2 vaccines for SARS-CoV have failed in animal tests in the past because they caused abnormal cytokine responses and lung lesions (T-helper immunopathology). In 17 years, no one has successfully discovered a safe and viable SARS vaccine.

This virus is a serious threat to the lives of people across the globe, and a national security threat beyond compare. We are all in grave danger with something like this on the loose. I implore the authorities to coordinate with virologists, epidemiologists, and critical care experts to come up with a plan of action. If this virus explodes in a major metropolitan area, you could see hundreds of thousands of terribly sick people swarming into hospitals and overflowing their surge capacity. The window of opportunity to prevent possibly millions of excess deaths is rapidly closing.

We should have had negative-pressure tent cities capable of treating tens of thousands of people established and staged outside major metropolitan areas at the beginning of February, in anticipation of pandemic spread. We need more oxygen concentrators and ventilators for the sick.

Please, investigate possible avenues of research and treatments. Dr. Todd Rider’s DRACO antiviral therapy could have saved thousands of lives already if he’d received a grant to continue his research. Remdesivir, Chloroquine, CytoSorb, Losartan, and Telmisartan could help patients right now.

This illness, if left unchecked, could kill hundreds of millions of people globally and severely damage the quality of life of billions more. There is an urgent need for money and resources to combat COVID-19.

We've seen from multiple sources, including books written before this outbreak, that there is a group of thousands of people overseas whose job is to influence public opinion. (And for those who haven't read that in the many newspapers, magazines, and the recent books that have covered the subject - see sources in my responses to comments below.)

In the first few weeks of this outbreak, that group had made 400,000 comments online, which were all part of the campaign to portray the US's annual flu bug as somehow ""worse than"" this virus.  All that has been revealed to be a lie.

But in the past 2 or 3 days, I've seen more and more of those kinds of comments on this sub.  Some of them are pretty clever - they'll make a mix of comments, sometimes sounding reasonable, but other times using the same account to accuse people of irrational ""panic"" and to post stats that purport to show the virus isn't that bad after all.

Another way they bury their intentions is by posting short comments on several non-virus subs, before they start posting their downplay comments.  They'll comment on a recipe, a car model, a piece of software, and then tell you that you have no reason to fear this virus.  It makes their post history look more believable, but it's all crap.

Just be aware that quite a number of the reddit accounts created from December 2019 through present were created for the sole purpose of influencing public opinion favorably toward this virus and the country of its origin.

fcdv6s,CoronavirusFOS,"Theory: If you're in the US and have been procrastinating about getting your pandemic prepping done, you are almost out of time...",3/2/2020 23:41,"Edit:  I posted the below warning on March 2, 2020.  I can't edit post titles, just post content, otherwise I'd edit it to say:

#If you're in the US and waited this long to get your pandemic prepping done, it's too late.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're at a tipping point in the USA today [March 2, 2020].  With the first two virus deaths on US soil reported over this past weekend (update:  and now it's a day later we're at 7 deaths), and new cases quickly popping up in multiple states, and a health emergency declared in the state of Florida, we are witnessing what will be a sudden shift from the majority of people not being worried about it, to a substantial number of people deciding that today or this week is finally the time to go out and buy all the rice, beans, gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, tylenol, etc. that they can find.  

This week is when people will begin to stop believing the disinformation campaign that ""it's not as bad as the flu"" and ""it won't get to the US.""  This week is when America will wake up.  This will be tied to the stock market - either we wake up first and then the market will crash, or the market crash is what will finally wake up some more of our citizens.

Many redditors have been quietly stocking up on long-term food supplies, a few common over-the-counter medicines, and other pandemic supplies since at least late January.  Those of us who are already prepared are now going to sit back and watch the videos showing empty shelves and people fighting over the last quart of hand sanitizer or the last 25-lb bag of rice.  Those of us who prepared early are not going to be willing to risk going to the bulk goods store soon; soon we will be turning inwards to our own stocks of food rather than risking getting infected by going to the store.

Wait about two more weeks [edit: about March 16, 2020], and you may find that your favorite stores have been unable to restock common items - anything from toothbrushes to band-aids to diapers to generic drugs and over-the-counter medicines - because 80% of that stuff comes from China, and international shipping is dramatically reduced; ships from China are sailing at 95% empty.  I expect supply chain disruptions to last anywhere from 30 days to July or beyond.

Twitter has shown panic buying in multiple parts of the US, from Hawaii 2 days ago to California to Minnesota (UPDATE:  And Washington state, and Oregon...) as of yesterday.  If you have people in your family who you are responsible for feeding, it would be irresponsible to wait until panic buying is in your city before you try to stock up.

Honestly, seriously, truly, and sincerely:  I am NOT trying to be a fear-monger with this post, or any others of mine.  I am trying to save lives.  It is your civic duty to prepare yourself and your family to survive when grocery stores are closed or cannot restock or cannot open because their employees are sick.  It is your civic duty to prepare to stand up as an American and be self-sufficient for a month or longer.  You should never expect your government to save you or protect you from all harm; that's your individual responsibility.

Please do not ""hoard"" things for resale or for profiteering.  I'm not suggesting hoarding; I'm suggesting ending our dependence on daily trips to fast food joints, on going to the grocery two or three times a week, on eating out at restaurants daily, as millions of Americans do.  However:

**YOUR LIFE** may depend on how well you prepare yourself for disruptions to daily life.  Even the US CDC told us to get prepared for major disruptions.

**MY LIFE** may depend on how well you prepare yourself for food and medicine shortages, because I don't want to be the only person in my neighborhood who had the foresight to stock up before supplies were exhausted.  I don't want you coming and knocking on my door, begging for food or medicine.  I have enough for my family for a month or two.  I do not have enough for you.",126,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusFOS/comments/fcdv6s/theory_if_youre_in_the_us_and_have_been/

-people are stealing toilet paper from the bathrooms.
-they are busting open the dispensers. 
-they are stealing hand sanitizer from stores and also busting open the sanitizer dispensers around the mall and taking out the bags.
-there are people wearing paper towel masks taped to their face
-there was a woman I’m 99.9% sure had the virus in my store, she was sweaty and dry coughing, after she left the store with her son and husband, she was having trouble breathing, she collapsed in front of Chuckie Cheese and her husband helped carry her out. No one wanted to touch her. My store called security and all they could do/want to do is look at her sitting in one of the pay massage chairs getting her sweat and coughs all over it. After she left I told security, I demanded they get someone to wipe off all those chairs NOW. I had to go back into my store, I don’t know if the chairs got wiped down, an hour later I saw all three chairs filled by an older couple and young girl. Wtf. I’m getting kinda scared here. 
-I was told by several people that there ain’t any toilet paper in the city. 

This is not being reported. Why haven’t they closed the mall? Why are the coronavirus cases in Olympia not being reported.

The people you see in blue aprons do not work for Costco. We’re employed by CDS, a company that is hired by massive food companies to sell they’re product on the floor. We’re 3rd party between big brands and the store.

Samples at Costco are gone. It’s simply not healthy to serve food like that. So, the big companies stopped paying, and we’re not getting any money from them, which means we’re out of luck.

fd88ud,CoronavirusFOS,From a Healthcare Worker in the Middle of the Outbreak Near Seattle,3/4/2020 13:21,"As a front-line Urgent Care Nurse Practitioner working in the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak near Seattle, I would really love to have access to those “43 million stockpiled masks” and lab testing.

I realize Trump and Pence have been touting that this stockpile is a great thing, but I can think of a much better use for them than having them sit in a warehouse - I COULD BE WEARING ONE ON MY FACE - while I am exposed to dozens of really sick people during each of my shifts.

At my clinic, which saw the first known COVID-19 case in the US, I have to supply my own N95 respirator, while my employer insists that a simple surgical mask is adequate, and I luckily have some of my own after my last unprotected workplace exposure to active pulmonary TB. I was fit-tested at all of my previous healthcare employers and I know my size and technique for wearing.

Regarding COVID-19 testing, as of yet, we are still unable to to test anyone, and are unable to keep these patients with mild symptoms out of the clinic, where they can further the spread as we do not have the ability to isolate anyone, and the sick are mixed in with the injured.

The news outlets have been telling people with symptoms to get tested, without considering the practical flaw that we do not have a test currently available for these patients, and current CDC testing practices do not allow for our patients or staff members to be tested.

When a patient presents here with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, we are asked to run an influenza test and obtain a chest X-ray (if necessary) and send the patients home with symptomatic care recommendations unless they need admission to the hospital for management of serious disease.

While this is the correct way to medically manage patients with mild respiratory illness, it is not the way to contain a spreading infectious disease.

I personally was incredibly sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and was unable to get tested after talking with the Health Department and my employer. I didn’t qualify for testing since I wasn’t admitted to the hospital.

I strongly feel that the numbers of positive cases are artificially low because we just simply can’t test people. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that it’s not here. It is here.

We have had patients presenting here angry that they cannot be tested for COVID-19, yelling, cussing, throwing their dirty mask at us and even spitting their secretions on the floor and walls on their way out. Please don’t do that. We are not the ones making the decisions here, we are just the ones trying to triage, manage and treat those who are sick and injured...and, that is just gross.

Trust me, it’s not that we are withholding testing, it’s that we can not do it at this time. We are concerned too that we know this is in our local community and we don’t have any objective numbers.

Please wash your hands well, isolate if ill and seek health care only if seriously ill (needing life-saving interventions in the hospital).

The lack of access to testing is not unique to my employer at this time. All clinics in this area are like this and all of the local known cases have been within a 10-mile radius of us. Testing is only being done on those admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms without other known cause (negative influenza swab, and negative respiratory panel otherwise).

Obviously our current health care system’s protocols are missing some MAJOR STEPS in the management of this, but in the meantime, can I please get one of those 43 million masks?

Be prepared, this is likely to happen in the USA next",3/8/2020 20:22,"I watched the Italy quarantine unfold today from Seattle and thought this info could be useful to share with the larger group. (See below). 

****
I originally wrote this as a comment on someone’s post in this sub about being prepared for a quarantine in the US:

“I’m in Seattle and was reading an Italian newspaper this morning (early evening Italian time) online, and the news was that the military was surrounding Lombardia to expand a few quarantined areas, including a couple of small towns and possibly Bergamo (a larger town, not just a little village, outside of Milan). Sealing off Bergamo seemed crazy — it’s big, it has a busy international airport, and is home to several important industries.

It wasn’t just Bergamo after all.

When I checked the news again late afternoon today (middle of the night in Italy), it said the entire Lombardia region had been quarantined, along with 14 other nearby provinces (which turned out to be almost half of each nearby region) — these regions are essentially states. 

I mention the timing of me reading the paper here in Seattle, because in Italy they went to bed on Saturday night thinking a small part of Lombardia would be quarantined, and they woke up to the news that they were locked in and surrounded.

My friend in Lombardia called me when she woke up Sunday morning, and the first thing she said was, “I never thought this could happen here.” 

This is going to be us in King County / perhaps WA state in the next 7 - 10 days, I’m sure. Make sure you’re ready and prepared, or leave now before you’re locked in.

(And remember to any bullshit you may hear: countries  don’t lock in a quarter of its population and seal off entire states just because some old people died. Not sure what it is they’re not telling us about this virus, and not sure I want to know, but I’ve never seen anything like the current quarantine in Italy in my life—absolutely unprecedented, and we’ll be next).”

Hope this is useful for someone...

After all, it was a problem in Wuhan. Then we started hearing of cases in the single digits in other countries. But even then we thought it would be contained. Two weeks ago, Italy was among those countries reporting “some initial cases”. Today, Italy has imposed a Wuhan-style quarantine on 1/4 of its entire population for a period of 15 days. Meaning that those in the affected quarantine cannot venture out of their homes. I am certain that the Italians never would have thought in the initial stages that such measures would ever be imposed on them. So, you wanted to be prepared?

This is a disaster waiting to happen. Here are my concerns and getting infected is not 1.

1. Financial collapse: cant take cash out of bank
2. Family members dying
3. Kids without food
4. My cats :)
5. Violent crime.
6. Police takeing care of their own, not the public.
7. Supplys sold out 
8. Familys not prepared

FYI this is me being positive, I only have 2 weeks of supplies and im more prepared than the hundreds of low income families near me. 

Every step of prep is a grind and getting my whole family together is the last. I'm not looking forward to being a leader in the family. 

I hope people out there stop denying and start excepting the worst outcome. Get acquainted with the idea because if the worst outcome does happen, you will be familiar with the emotional reaction. The media cant tell people to not panic because it is not last minute choice.

fbwmzf,CoronavirusFOS,The real cause of the virus,3/2/2020 0:44,"Remember, the spread of the virus is precisely due to the arrogance and incompetence of almost every government. They put $$$ over peoples lives. There were many people claiming that this would be bad PRECISELY because all the data pointed to it being bad. The governments only made it worse. You can't expect bureaucrats, most who are actually imbeciles(literally, they know almost nothing useful to help society), to be able to comprehend such things. They just want $$$ and power and they hire ""experts"" who will tell them what they want to hear and then blame their experts when the SHTF.

Remember how much money is stolen and wasted by these people, what humanity could have achieved, and how greed arrogant psychopaths ruin it for everyone. History proves how they are yet everyone seems to always go back to playing their game. The real problem is not the virus, it is the ""leaders"". With proper intelligent leadership this virus would have done little damage. 

&#x200B;

Just remember, there is always something else on the horizon, even if you survive this virus, there might be something else just around the corner. Governments won't protect you, they never do, in fact, eventually they will destroy you. This is what happens when you elect people based on what they say or how they look or if they are part of the same gang as you. 

&#x200B;

Regardless of how this virus was created, what amplified it's power was the incompetence of governments. All of them, not just China but Italy, US, Germany, Japan, India, etc... If the economies are so fragile that business can't be shut down for a month to avoid worse case then something is wrong and bureaucrats have done too much to harm society. When they claim ""We must be keep things going or it will be an economic failure"" and then spread the disease and create an economic failure, something is wrong with their design and their logic. Why are they creating such fragile systems? Do they really have a clue what they are talking about? Are they just hammers? Why does an economist know about virology?

&#x200B;

The governments are incompetent. Look how South Korea is dealing with it, they are the only ones that have stepped up and are doing what is to be expected. US is intentionally not testing people and this is only making things much worse... just like CCP did. These large governments are full of imbeciles and when the SHTF they only make things much worse. The larger they are the less transparency and accountability they have. There is no voice of reason or debate and argument to flesh out the truth. It becomes a cult. They want to war monger, embezzle, and play their political games and allow society to crumble and then point the finger. 

There is a serious issue, the real plague of man is the governments. \[I'm not for anarchy, I'm for designing governments that do not destroy their societies. It is clear as day that no singular man can run massive societies. This isn't 1776 any more... although with nCoV we might very well go back to that\]",60,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusFOS/comments/fbwmzf/the_real_cause_of_the_virus/

We received a $3500 bill for $4500 in charges for a 2 hour visit. She received no actual medical treatment, just viral testing. I have received feedback for going to the ER. I get that. I knew UC would be cheaper - just not by an order of magnitude or so. I thought we'd be looking at $500 - $1000
